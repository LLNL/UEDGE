# !!! PLEASE DO NOT CVS-UPDATE THIS FILE WITH A REAL mmm Configure FILE !!!

# This is a dummy Configure file.
# The Configure actually read by config is generated by ProgramMake from
# Configure.sys and the .pack files, and overwrites this file.

# A dummy is in cvs so that Configure exists at the first execution of mmm
# after initial uedge checkout (if it doesn't, the user's Configure does not
# get added to the config line).

--------------------------------------------------------

The mmm code-building-related files have been reorganized and now use only
the newer (post basis-version 9) named files.

The mmm files as of 7/28/98, which used a combination of old and new for
the build, have been "cvs updated"'d or "cvs remove"'d; removed files can
be found in the cvs "Attic."  To obtain the lot of the old files, go to
some convenient new directory and type
   cvs co -r MMM_RELATED_FILES_OLDWAY uedge
To build with these files, go to your uedge directory with the latest sources,
   rm Co* M* T* P* uedge.pack
   rm */P* */M*
and then cp -p the old files over.  The -p preserves dates, and affects what
mmm does.  (If this procedure gets to be inconvenient, a simple csh-script
could be written to carry it out. Also, I would think that version 9 builds
could and probably should be made to work with the */MMM files ln -s 'd to
the new */Package files; if not, e.g., if SYSTEM does not exist in version 9,
the */Package files should not be used at all the old way: the tag should be
removed on */Package, and the MMM and Makepkg.cpu files should be udpated
to be complete for version 9 builds.)

 --  mmm files uedge/*/MMM have been removed; Package files remain (VDF = etc.)

 --  mmm file uedge/Top has been removed and ProgramMake updated (make-commands
     for xuedge; generates Configure). Makefile.UN* have been removed.

 --  mmm files uedge/*/Makepkg.CPU have been removed and files
     uedge/*/PackageMake updated where needed (Macros =; make-variables=;
     make-commands possible).

 --  config input-file Configure.sys has been added; Configure is constructed
     from uedge.pack, uedge/*/*.pack, and Configure.sys. (As far as I can tell
     the .pack files were no longer being used with mmm versions gt 9, but
     the */*.pack files were consistent with Configure version 1.12.)

SYSTEM directives for platform-dependent load-line settings appear in
files ProgramMake and Configure.sys.  Public basis' settings are in
$BASIS_ROOT/include/Configure.

The best documentation for config and mmm is in the "man pages," or
the files themselves (perl scripts) in $BASIS_ROOT/bin.
