Colleagues,
 I have put atomic data for hydrogen and impurities for divertor modelling
on my Sun workstation as a series of files:
        The two hydrogen files are: nwfits and results
        nwfits is a file of the fits with some notes at the end of the file
on how to read it. results is a file that contains the data in tables that
you can easily interpret, but the data has only a few significant figures.
To avoid confusion, I have given the radiation rate for hydrogen rather
than the energy loss per ionization. To get the hydrogen radiation loss
rate in ergs/cm^3/s, you multiply the rate by the electron density and the
neutral hydrogen density.  The files are small (~ 35 kbytes). The reference
for the data is:  R. Janev, D. Post, W. Langer, K. Evans, D. Heifetz, and 
J. Weisheit, J. Nucl. Mat. 121 (1984), 10. That article and the references
therein will allow you to understand the basis of the data. 
        The impurity radiation data is the emissivity as a function of
temperature, neutral fraction, and density times residence time for a
initially neutral impurity atom. There is one file for each impurity. The
impurity  files are large ( ~ 1.5 Mbytes) . If you would like them in a
more abreviated format, let me know and I will try to accomodate you. .The
references for the data are:  R. Hulse, D. Post, and D. Mikkelsen,  J.
Phys. B: Atom. Molec. Phys. 13(1980) 3895, R. Hulse, Nucl. Techn./Fus.
3(1983) 259, and D. Post, R. Jensen, C. Tarter, W. Grasberger, and W.
Lokke, At. Data and Nuc. Tables, 20(1977),397.
        We will be updating the files from time to time.

To access the data, you should access a Sun workstation here at pppl using
anonymous ftp. A sample session (with thanks to Tina Ludescher and Charles
Karney) follows (use your own username as the password):

$ ftp orion.pppl.gov
