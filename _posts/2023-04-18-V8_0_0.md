For a full list of the changes, users are advised to compare GitHub tags. Outlined below are listed the routines/parts of the code that are affected by v8.0.0 compared to v7.0.8

- Namespaces no longer flattened
- Updated makefiles and source files to be compatible with modern compilers
  - Many small changes over majority of files
- Some default variables changed: unless specified in the input, these variables will have different values in V8.0.0 vs V7.X
  - iswflxlvgy=0 -> 1
  - iswflxltgy=0 -> 1
    - Radial gas flux limits active on radial boundaries by default
  - recycm=0.1->-0.9
    - Momentum recycling coefficient
- .uedgerc.py initialization script executed if available
  - exec(open(‚Ä¶)) -> to allow defining general variables (e.g. rate paths)
  - Priority: cwd > $HOME
- com.geometry options added for ‚Äòsnowflake135‚Äô and ‚Äòsnowflake165‚Äô
- istabon=17 option added 
  - Switch to use ehr5.dat files for hydrogen rates
