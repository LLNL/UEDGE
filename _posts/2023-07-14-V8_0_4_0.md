excerpt: Bugfix for neutral viscosity loop
---
Fixed bug in neutral viscosity loop

    Do loop ended at radial index ny rather than ny+1
    Changes affect the Jacobian calculation
    Does not affect the full RHS evaluation
    Bug should not affect the steady-state solution
    Bugfix should improve convergence behavior to steady-state

Advanced version to 8.0.4-patch0 as a precaution: converged fnorms may change after updating, negligible impact on steady-state solution expected
