excerpt: Bugfix for grid generation when nxxpt>0
---

Fixed grid generation bug implemented in commit 82f5f64. 
Bug affected grid generation when adding cells around the X-point (nxxpt>0).
No impact on steady state solutions.

- Non-base 1 array pointers were uniquely passed to subroutine intersect2. 
- Originally implemented as cray pointers, which used to cause warnings but was escalated to errors. 
- During updating passing to be compatible, non-base 1 array resulted in error. 
- Updated to explicitly define shape of passed arrays.
