The dce (for Distributed Computing Environment) provides
access to a series of RPC routines. This package was 
conceived of at a time when Uedge was almost exclusively
run on Cray computers at the NERSC facility. Computer time
was expensive, and the Cray response was not particularly 
fast with regard to wall time. The dce routines are mostly
meant for data visualization which is done in realtime. 
I will not document the routines here as that already exists
elsewhere. The main routine is rzxform which simply does a 
polyfill of the Uedge grid space onto a rectalinear r-z
grid to be visualized with any one of many imaging tools.
With the advent of fast, and cheap, desktop workstations
this package is rapidly becoming obsolete. 

Version 1 - All the routines in version 1 are provided by
an rpc server. It first attempts to utilize the "well known
port" 12100. This makes it easier to tunnel through firewalls
or across networks. If that fails the portmapper is used
to determine the server port. The "well known port" can be
turned off by modifying PackageMake.

Version 2 - In this version the rzxform routine has been brought
directly into Uedge, instead of being served as an rpc.
