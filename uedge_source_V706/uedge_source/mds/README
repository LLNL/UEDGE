Initial commit of mds package for accessing data stored in MDSPlus.
This package is configured "off" in this commit since it requires
the MDSPlus libraries to be installed to successfully load caltrans.
I've built this using the client/server mode of MDSPlus. I do not
know if it will work with local mode, I'll have to build the package
on a platform with a local MDSPlus to test this. For the client/server
mode the MDSPlus libraries required are MdsIpUtil and MdsIpShr. In order
to build these I found I had to "make" in the MDSPlus src tree 
subdirectories tdishr, mdsshr, mdslibidl, mdstcpip, and mdslib. I've 
included an example basis script in the package directory that shows
access to time series data stored in ptdata, accessing inter-shot
efit results, and the beginnings of accessing Thomson data. The
arguments to mdsvalue have a rather picky syntax so follow the example
closely.
