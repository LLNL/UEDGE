The following instructions are for the built-in grid generator in UEDGE. For grids produced by external tools, e.g., 
INGRID the instructions will be posted separately.

You can implement a target plate geometry as follows:

(1) Generate an orthogonal grid, i.e., the plate is the line orthogonal to flux surfaces and passing through the
respective strike point

(2) Create a python source file plate.blah.py with target plates data that looks like this:

# for inboard half of mesh:
grd.nplate1=3
grd.gchange("grd.Mmod",0)
grd.rplate1=[1.55E+00, 1.55E+00,  1.55E+00]
grd.zplate1=[1.8E+00, 1.6E+00, 1.4E+00]

# for outboard half of mesh:
grd.nplate2=4
grd.gchange("grd.Mmod",0)
grd.rplate2=[2.1, 2.0, 1.9, 1.8]
grd.zplate2=[1.6, 1.5, 1.4, 1.3]

Here are arrays in R and Z containing the coordinates defining the inner and outer plates as piece-wise linear curves. Note: (i) the 
plate should fully cut across the leg, i.e., should cover the range of flux surfaces, from psi0min2 to psi0max, (ii) the plate should 
pass through the strike point of the original (orthogonal) grid, and (iii) the plate cannot cut into the domain above the X-point level.

THen you import those arrays in PyUEDGE by doing execfile("plate.blah.py") in Python2, or an equivalent command in Python3.

(3) Use settings:
com.ismmon=3; grd.istream=0; grd.iplate=1; grd.nsmooth=2; grd.wtmesh1=0.75; grd.dmix0=1.0
Some of these are optional, see the variables description.

(4) Generate non-orthogonal grid:
grd.grdrun()

(5) Run the code with additional settings
com.isnonog=1; bbb.methg=66
