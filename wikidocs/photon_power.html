Radiation power on the target plate is calculated only as post-processing in UEDGE, so it has no 
effect on the target sputtering etc.

To calculate the photon radiation power, first call subroutine bbb.pradpltwl(). 

The outputs are stored in arrays bbb.pwr_plth(0:ny+1,2*nxpt) and bbb.pwr_pltz(0:ny+1,2*nxpt),
and in arrays pwr_wallh(0:nx+1) and pwr_wallz(0:nx+1).

Array bbb.pwr_plth is for hydrogenic raditaion power flux on target plates [W/m^2]; bbb.pwr_pltz 
is for impurity radiation power [W/m^2]. Each contains two columns (for single X-point), the first 
one is for the inner plate, the second one for the outer plate. The other index is the radial index 
of cells along the target plates. 

Arrays pwr_wallh(0:nx+1) and pwr_wallz(0:nx+1), contain hydrogenic and impurity radiation power flux 
on the outer wall [W/m^2], the index corresponds to the poloidal location.
