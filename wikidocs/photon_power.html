Radiation power on the target plate is calculated only as post-processing in UEDGE, so it has no effect on the target sputtering etc.
To calculate the photon radiation power, first call subroutine bbb.pradpltwl(). Then the outputs are stored in arrays bbb.pwr_plth and bbb.pwr_pltz. Array bbb.pwr_plth is for hydrogenic raditaion power flux on target plates [W/m^2]; bbb.pwr_pltz is for impurity radiation power [W/m^2]. Each contains two columns (for single X-point), the first one is for the inner plate, the second one for the outer plate. The other index is the radial index of cells along the target plates.
