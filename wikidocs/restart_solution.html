To restart a solution, UEDGE needs 
(1) flag set bbb.restart=1
(2) save state variables: tes, tis, nis, ups, ngs, phis
(3) various physics model settings and a grid file matching the saved solution.
(4) if a grid file is not available then eqdsk files data and various geometric settings 
are needed to allow recalculating the grid.

The save state variables names are just the names of UEDGE 2D fluid variables with added "s".
These are distinct from the current state variables in UEDGE:  te, ti, ni, up, ng, phi.
In general current state variables and save state variables don't match but after 
successful convergence of a time step the latest values of current state variables values 
are assigned to the save state variables.

To restart a solution, normally the save state variables values are imported by restoring a savefile; 
however some other ways may be possible to set save variables.

Here is the basic sequence of restoring a UEDGE solution:
***first apply various settings for physics and geometry, including recalculation of the grid, 
if necessary, to reproduce the physics model and geometry settings matching the restored solution ***
  
bbb.restart=1
hdf5_restore("my_save_file.h5")
bbb.ftol=1e-8; bbb.dtreal=1e20; bbb.exmain() #-this should be a converged solution
