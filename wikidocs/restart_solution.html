To restart a solution, UEDGE needs 
(1) flag set bbb.restart=1
(2) save variables: tes, tis, nis, ups, ngs, phis
(3) either a grid file gridue (matching the dimensions of save variables) or
eqdsk files and various settings allowing recalculating the grid.

The save variables names are the names of UEDGE 2D fluid variables with added "s".
These are distinct from the current state variables te, ti, ni, up, ng, phi.
After successful convergence of a time step, the save variables are updated, the latest values of
current state variables values are assigned to the save variables.

To restart a solution, normally save variables values are imported by restoring a savefile; 
however some other ways may be possible to set save variables.

Here is the basic sequence of restoring a UEDGE solution:
<various settings including recalculation of the grid, if necessary>
bbb.restart=1
hdf5_restore("my_save_file.h5")
bbb.ftol=1e-8; bbb.dtreal=1e20; bbb.exmain() #-this should be a converged solution
