UEDGE allows interpolating a solution to a new grid. Here is the usual way to refine the grid:
1) first obtain a solution from scratch on a very crude grid
2) interpolate the previous solution to a finer grid
3) drive the solution to a steady state
4) repeat steps 2,3 several more times as needed


Here is the basic workflow for resizing (usually refining) the grid

*** First, calculate (or restore) a solution on an old grid ***

##-change grid settings, e.g., 
    com.nysol[0]=6
    com.nxleg[0,1]=8

##-set flags for using a new grid:
    bbb.restart=1; bbb.newgeo=1
    bbb.icntnunk=0 #-this one may be needed
    
##-use some small time step to start running on the new grid
    bbb.dtreal = 1e-14; bbb.ftol=1e-10;
    bbb.isbcwdt=1; bbb.itermx=30; bbb.exmain()
