This python test area is setup to be run with the "pytest" module. You may 
need to load this into your Anaconda Python environment with:

    pip install pytest pytest-xdist

Then to run all the tests type:

    pytest --forked --tb=native

To run the test in a specific folder:

    pytest --forked --tb=native <path to folder of tests>

To run just a specific test you can either do this while in this directory:

    pytest --forked --tb=native <path to test folder>

or

    cd <path to test folder>
    pytest --forked --tb=native

Repeat for any desired test.


To make directory of tests based on an updated uedge version,
execute
    
    python MakeTests.py
