C***DESCRIPTION
C
C                          ****  Abstract  ****
C
C  BSPDOC is a non-executable documentation routine. Its purpose is  to
C  describe a suite of subprograms for performing basic operations with
C  piecewise polynomial (PP) functions. The operations included are (a)
C  evaluation  of PP functions and their derivatives, (b) interpolation
C  using PP functions, (c) numerical integration of PP  functions,  and
C  (d)  utility  operations such as evaluating B-spline basis functions
C  and converting between various  representations  for  PP  functions.
C  Also included are routines for interpolating gridded data in two and
C  three  dimensions  using  tensor  products  of  one-dimensional   PP
C  functions.
C
C                         ****  Background  ****
C
C  The basic package described here is a modification of  that  of  (de
C  Boor, 1977).  It differs from that package in the following ways:
C
C    * Names have been altered to prevent duplication  and  conflicts
C      with routines from (de Boor, 1978).
C    * The call lists used here are different.
C    * Work vectors were  added  to  ensure  portability  and  proper
C      execution  in  an overlay environment These work arrays can be
C      used for other purposes except as noted in BSPVhN.
C    * While most of the original routines in (de  Boor,  1977)  were
C      restricted  to orders 20 or less, this restriction was removed
C      from all routines except the quadrature  routine  BSQAD.  (See
C      the  section  below  on  differentiation  and  integration for
C      details.)
C
C  In 1990 the package was revised and  expanded.   Among  the  changes
C  introduced were:
C
C    * The existing B-spline evaluation routine, BVALU, was  replaced
C      by B1VAhL.
C    * Routines for  parametric  interpolation  of  arbitrary  planar
C      curves were added.
C    * Routines for interpolation of gridded data in  two  and  three
C      dimensions were added.
C
C  All the routines in the package are available  in  both  single  and
C  double  precision  versions. The double precision routines names are
C  obtained from the single precision names by prefixing with a D.  For
C  example,  B1VAhL  and  DB1VAhL  are  the  single  and double precision
C  routines for evaluating a B-spline or any of its derivatives in  the
C  B-representation.
C
C               ****  Piecewise Polynomial Functions  ****
C
C  Let x(1), x(2), ..., x(m) be a  strictly  increasing  sequence  with
C  x(1)=a and x(m)=b. This defines a subdivision of the interval (a,b).
C  A set of m-1 polynomials of fixed degree  k-1,  each  defined  on  a
C  unique  subinterval  (x(j),x(j+1)),  j=1,2,  ...,  m-1,  is called a
C  piecewise polynomial (PP) function of order k. If  the  PP  function
C  has  k-2 continuous derivatives on (a,b), then it is called a spline
C  of order k.
C
C  A PP function is uniquely determined by
C
C    (a) the number of subintervals m
C    (b) the order (degree+1) of the polynomial pieces k
C    (c) an increasing breakpoint sequence x(1),...,x(m)
C    (d) m-1 sets of k polynomial coefficients  (c(i,j),  i=1,...,k),
C        one for each subinterval, j=1,...,m-1
C
C  On the jth subinterval (x(j),x(j+1)) the function may be written
C
C                   k                  i-1
C         p(j,x) = SUM ( c(i,j)(x-x(j))    / (i-1)! )
C                  i=1
C
C  This is the so-called PP-representation for PP functions.  Note that
C  the  "polynomial  coefficients"  given here are actually the (right)
C  derivatives at the breakpoints.
C
C  Each of the m-1 polynomial pieces has k coefficients, making a total
C  of  k(m-1) parameters. In the most general case, the PP function and
C  its derivatives have m-2 jumps, one at each of the breakpoints x(j),
C  j=2,...,m-1.   Continuity   requirements   at  the  breakpoints  add
C  constraints and reduce the  number  of  free  parameters.  If  a  PP
C  function  is  continuous  at  each  of the m-2 interior breakpoints,
C  there are k(m-1)-(m-2) free parameters; if in addition  the  PP  has
C  continuous   first   derivatives,   there   are  k(m-1)-2(m-2)  free
C  parameters, etc., until we get to a spline where we have  k(m-1)-(k-
C  1)(m-2)  =  m+k-2  free  parameters.  Thus,  the  principle  is that
C  increasing the continuity of derivatives  decreases  the  number  of
C  free parameters and conversely.
C
C  The PP-representation is easy to understand and  fast  to  evaluate.
C  However,  when  trying to find a PP function which satisfies special
C  properties  (e.g.,   continuity,   interpolation)   an   alternative
C  representation is preferred. This is the so-called B-representation.
C  Here we write the PP function in the form
C
C                                 n
C                       p(x)  =  SUM a(i) b(i,x)
C                                i=1
C
C  That is, the PP function  is  expanded  in  a  fixed  basis  b(i,x),
C  i=1,...,n, and the a(i) are the free parameters. The basis functions
C  are splines which are zero except on (at most) k adjoining intervals
C  where  each  b(i,x)  is  positive  and,  in most cases, hat or bell-
C  shaped.
C
C  Since each basis function is a spline,  any  linear  combination  of
C  them  must  also  be  a spline, and hence the sum for p(x) above can
C  only produce splines.  A convenient way to  represent  PP  functions
C  with  less  continuity  is  to allow more than one breakpoint at the
C  same location.  Since we  defined  the  breakpoint  sequence  to  be
C  strictly  increasing  we  use  the  term knot sequence to denote the
C  nondecreasing sequence of breakpoints with each multiple  breakpoint
C  counted  multiple  times.  If two knots are allowed to come together
C  at some x(j), then we say that we have  a  knot  of  multiplicity  2
C  there,  and  the knot values are the x(j) values.  If we reverse the
C  procedure of the first paragraph, we find  that  adding  a  knot  to
C  increase  multiplicity  increases the number of free parameters and,
C  according to the principle above, thereby introduces a discontinuity
C  in  what  was  the highest continuous derivative at that knot. Thus,
C  the number of free parameters is n = l+k-2, where l is  the  sum  of
C  multiplicities at the x(i) values with x(1) and x(m) of multiplicity
C  1.  If l = m, all knots are simple, and we have a spline.  Each knot
C  can have a multiplicity of at most k.
C
C  In order for the nonzero part of b(1,x)  to  be  a  spline  covering
C  (x(1),x(2)), it is necessary to put k-1 additional knots to the left
C  of a.  Similarly, it is necessary to place k-1 additional  knots  to
C  the  right of b.  We see that the number of knots is l+2(k-1) = n+k.
C  We denote the knot  sequence  by  t(j),  j=1,  ...,  n+k.   In  many
C  problems where extrapolation beyond a or b is not anticipated, it is
C  common practice to set t(1)=t(2)=...=t(k)=a  and  t(n+1)=t(n+2)=...=
C  t(n+k)=b.
C
C  In summary, the B-representation of a PP function is given by,
C
C    (a) the order (degree+1) of the polynomial pieces k
C    (b) an nondecreasing knot sequence t(1),...,t(n+k)
C    (c) the coefficients a(i), i = 1,...,n
C
C  A PP function written using the B-representation is known  as  a  B-
C  spline.
C
C  The nonzero part of the basis function b(i,x) lies in  the  interval
C  (t(i),t(i+k)).  The fact that each basis function is nonzero over at
C  most k intervals means that for a given x value, there are at most k
C  nonzero  terms  of  the  sum  defining  p(x).  This  leads to banded
C  matrices in linear algebra problems, and references (de Boor,  1978)
C  and  (Hanson,  1979)  take  advantage of this in constructing higher
C  level routines to achieve speed and avoid ill-conditioning.
C
C                       ****  Basic Routines  ****
C
C  (Note: in the following we use upper case names  to  denote  Fortran
C  variables used in calling the routines in the B-spline package.)
C
C  The basic routines which most  casual  users  will  need  are  those
C  concerned   with   direct   evaluation   of  PP  functions.  The  B-
C  representation is preferred because of  numerical  stability.   Here
C  one  must  supply   the number of coefficients N, the order K of the
C  polynomial pieces (of degree K-1), the  knots  (T(j),  j=1,...,N+K),
C  and  the  B-spline  coefficients (A(i), i=1,...,N).  To evaluate the
C  B-spline or any of its derivatives at a point XVAL, one can use
C
C               Y = B1VAhL(XVAL,ID,T,N,K,A,INBV,WORK,IFLAG)
C
C  where ID  is  a  non-negative  integer  indicating  that  the  ID-th
C  derivative  is  desired (ID=0 gives function value itself).  INBV is
C  an initialization parameter which is set to 1 by  users  before  the
C  first call; distinct splines require distinct INBV parameters.  WORK
C  is a scratch array of length at least 3K,  and  IFLAG  is  a  return
C  code.
C
C  When more conventional  communication  is  needed  for  publication,
C  physical interpretation, etc., the B-representation can be converted
C  to to the PP-representation by
C
C                  CALL BSPPP(T,A,N,K,LDC,C,X,LX,WORK)
C
C  This  call  returns  the  number  of  polynomial  pieces   LX,   the
C  breakpoints  (distinct knots) (X(j),  j=1,...,LX+1), and the (right)
C  derivatives C(*,j) at each breakpoint X(j).  Here  LDC.GE.K  is  the
C  leading  dimension  of  the  matrix C and WORK is a scratch array of
C  length at least (N+3)K. To evaluate  the  B-spline  or  any  of  its
C  derivatives in this representation, one uses
C
C                 Y = PPVAL(LDC,C,X,LX,K,ID,XVAL,INPPV)
C
C  INPPV is an initialization parameter which is  set  to  1  by  users
C  before the first call.
C
C  A major reason for considering PPVAL  is  that  evaluation  is  much
C  faster than that from B1VAhL.  However, one must view this conversion
C  from the B- to the PP-representation with  some  skepticism  because
C  the conversion may result in the loss of significant digits when the
C  B-spline varies in an almost discontinuous fashion.  To determine to
C  what  extent  the  conversion  process  loses  digits,  compute  the
C  relative difference ABS((Y1-Y2)/Y2) for a set of x's on  (a,b)  with
C  Y1 from PPVAL and Y2 from B1VAhL.
C
C  No  routines  are  supplied  to  explicitly  convert  from  the  PP-
C  representation to the B-representation.  However, one can obtain the
C  B-representation by evaluating the PP function (using PPVAL)  at  an
C  appropriate  number  of  abscissas  to  create  data  for use by the
C  interpolation routine  BINThK  (see  below),  which  returns  the  B-
C  representation.   In order to correctly generate a knot sequence for
C  the B-representation one must know the smoothness of the PP function
C  at  each  of  the  breakpoints.  If the PP function is of continuity
C  class C(j) in the neighborhood of a  given  breakpoint,  then  k-1-j
C  knots  are required there.  If the function itself is discontinuous,
C  k-2 knots are required.  The total number of knots  must  be  n+k  =
C  l+2(k-1),  where  l  is  the  sum  of the multiplicities required to
C  obtain the required level of smoothness at the breakpoints.  If  the
C  PP  function is a spline, then l=m; otherwise l must be greater (see
C  the description of l above).
C
C  Recall that jump discontinuities in a PP function or its derivatives
C  can  occur  at  breakpoints.   B1VAhL and PPVAL return right-limiting
C  values in these cases.  An  exception  occurs  for  XVAL=X(LX+1)  in
C  PPVAL  or  for  XVAL=T(N+K) for B1VAhL where left-limiting values are
C  returned. Note also that  a  computed  XVAL  which,  mathematically,
C  would  be  a  breakpoint  value  may differ from the breakpoint by a
C  round-off error.  When this happens in evaluating a discontinuous PP
C  function   or  some  discontinuous  derivative,  the  value  at  the
C  breakpoint and the value at XVAL can be radically different. In this
C  case, setting XVAL to a T or X value makes the computation precise.
C
C                       ****  Interpolation  ****
C
C  Given a set of data points ((Y(i),F(i)), i=1,...,N),  the  order  K,
C  and  the knot sequence (T(j), j=1,...,N+K), BINThK generates B-spline
C  coefficients (A(i),i=1,...,N) which define a PP function which  will
C  interpolate the data by calls to B1VAhL.  A similar interpolation can
C  also be done for cubic splines using BINTh4.
C
C              ****  Differentiation and Integration  ****
C
C  Derivatives of PP  functions  are  obtained  from  B1VAhL  or  PPVAL.
C  Integrals  are  obtained  from  BSQAD using the B-representation and
C  PPQAD  using  the  PP-representation.  More  complicated   integrals
C  involving  the  product  of a function F and some derivative of a PP
C  function can be evaluated with BFQAD or PFQAD using the  B-  or  PP-
C  representations  respectively.  All  quadrature routines, except for
C  PPQAD, are limited in accuracy to 18 digits  or  working  precision,
C  whichever is smaller. PPQAD is limited to working precision only. In
C  addition, the order K for BSQAD is limited to 20 or less. If  orders
C  greater than 20 are required, use BFQAD with F(X) = 1.
C
C                       ****  Extrapolation  ****
C
C  Extrapolation outside the interval (a,b) can be accomplished  easily
C  by  the  PP-representation  using PPVAL.  However, caution should be
C  exercised, especially when multiple knots are located at a or  b  or
C  when  the  extrapolation  is carried significantly beyond a or b. On
C  the other hand, B1VAhL returns zero for XVAL  outside  (T(1),T(N+K)),
C  and   hence  some  manipulation  of  the  knots  may  be  needed  to
C  extrapolate with B1VAhL.
C
C                ****  Curve Fitting and Smoothing  ****
C
C  Unless one has many accurate data points,  direct  interpolation  is
C  not  recommended  for summarizing data. The results are often not in
C  accordance with intuition since the fitted curve tends to  oscillate
C  through  the  set  of  points.  Monotone splines (see SLATEC routine
C  PCHDOC (Fritsch and Carlson, 1980)) can help  curb  this  undulating
C  tendency  but  constrained  least  squares is more likely to give an
C  acceptable fit  with  fewer  parameters.   The  SLATEC  routine  FC,
C  described  in  (Hanson,  1978), is recommended for this purpose. The
C  output from this fitting process is the B-representation.
C
C                   **** Parametric Interpolation ****
C
C  Given a set of data points ((X(i),Y(i)), i=1,...,N),  the  order  K,
C  and  the  parameter  breakpoint  sequence  (P(i),  i=1,...,N), BINKP
C  generates a knot sequence (T(j),  j=1,...,N+K),  and  parametric  B-
C  spline    coefficients   ((AX(i),AY(i)),   i=1,...,N)   which   will
C  interpolate the data by calls to B1VAhL.  That  is,  the  x-component
C  function  has B-representation T,N,K,AX and the y-component function
C  has B-representation T,N,K,AY determined so that
C
C              x(P(i)) = X(i),  y(P(i)) = Y(i), i=1,...,N.
C
C  Parametric interpolation is suitable when  the  data  are  arbitrary
C  points in the plane, and do not necessarily represent a functional
C  dependence of Y on X.
C
C  A similar interpolation  can  also  be  done  for  parametric  cubic
C  splines using BIN4P.  An auxiliary routine PARGN is available to aid
C  in the determination of a  suitable  parameter  breakpoint  sequence
C  (P(i),i=1,...,N).
C
C                  ****  Tensor Product B-splines  ****
C
C  One can easily build up multidimensional B-splines  (on  rectangular
C  regions)  using  tensor  products  of one-dimensional B-splines.  We
C  illustrate this process in two dimensions.  Here such a function may
C  be written as
C
C                            nx   ny
C                p(x,y)  =  SUM  SUM  a(i,j) b(i,x) b(j,y)
C                           i=1  j=1
C
C  where the functions b(i,x) and b(j,y) are  one-dimensional  B-spline
C  basis  functions.  Distinct orders and knot sequences may be used in
C  each direction.  Note that for each fixed value of y p(x,y) is a  PP
C  function of x alone, and for each fixed x p(x,y) is a PP function of
C  y alone.  The function B2VAhL is designed to evaluate PP functions of
C  this  type.   B3VAL  performs  the  corresponding operation in three
C  dimensions.
C
C               ****  Multidimensional Interpolation  ****
C
C  The routines B2INhT and B3INT produce tensor product B-splines  which
C  interpolate  gridded data in two and three dimensions, respectively.
C  By gridded data  in  two  dimensions  we  mean  ((X(i),Y(j),F(i,j)),
C  i=1,...,NX, j=1,...,NY).
C
C                          ****  Summary  ****

C  Below we list the routines in this package according  to  what  jobs
C  they  perform.  The notation (D)SUB indicates that the routine comes
C  in both single and double precision. The single  precision  name  is

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C   B3INT determines the parameters of a function that interpolates the
C   three-dimensional  gridded data (X(i),Y(j),Z(k),FCN(i,j,k)) for
C   i=1,..,NX, j=1,..,NY, and k=1,..,NZ. The interpolating function and
C   its derivatives may subsequently be evaluated by function B3VAL.
C
C   The interpolating function is a piecewise polynomial (pp) function
C   represented as a tensor product of one-dimensional B-splines.  The
C   form of this function is
C
C                        NX   NY   NZ
C          S(x,y,z)  =  SUM  SUM  SUM  a    U (x) V (y) W (z)
C                       i=1  j=1  k=1   ijk  i     j     k
C
C   where the functions U(i), V(j), and W(k) are one-dimensional B-
C   spline basis functions. The coefficients a(i,j,k) are chosen so
C
C   S(X(i),Y(j),Z(k))=FCN(i,j,k) for i=1,..,NX, j=1,..,NY, k=1,..,NZ.
C
C   Note that for fixed y and z S is a pp function of x alone, for
C   fixed x and z S is a pp function of y alone, and for fixed x and y
C   S is a pp function of z alone.  In one dimension a pp function may
C   be created by partitioning a given interval into subintervals and
C   defining a distinct polynomial on each one.  The points where
C   adjacent subintervals meet are called knots.  Each of the functions
C   U(i), V(j), and W(k) above is a piecewise polynomial.
C
C   Users of B3INT choose the order (degree+1) of the polynomial pieces
C   used to define the interpolant in each of the x, y and z directions
C   (KX, KY, and KZ). Users also may define their own knot sequences in
C   x, y and z separately (TX, TY, and TZ).  If IFLAG=0, however, B3INT
C   will choose knots that result in a pp interpolant with KX-2, KY-2
C   and KZ-2 continuous partial derivatives in x, y and z respectively.
C   The interpolating function is identically zero outside the rectan-
C   gular region defined by the knots.  See below for more information
C   on knot selection.
C
C   After a call to B3INT, all information necessary to define the
C   interpolating function is contained in the parameters NX, NY, NZ,
C   KX, KY, KZ, TX, TY, TZ, and FCN. These quantities should not be
C   altered until after the last call of the evaluation routine B3VAL.

C   ---------------------------
C
C   In this section we describe the relationship between data points
C   and knots.  Users who choose to let B3INT select the knot sequences
C   TX, TY and TZ (by setting IFLAG=1) may skip this discussion.
C
C   To describe the relationship between knots and data points we first
C   consider the simpler case of one-dimensional interpolation; in
C   particular, we consider interpolating the data X(i), i=1,..,N with
C   a pp function of order K.
C
C   Knots are the points where the individual polynomial pieces join up,
C   and hence where the pp function may suffer a loss of smoothness.  To
C   define a pp function, one needs N+K knots. If the knots are distinct
C   the interpolant will be as smooth as possible (continuous, with K-2
C   continuous derivatives). If two adjacent knots come together, the
C   smoothness of the function is reduced at that point. In general, if
C   M knots are assigned to the same point, the pp function will have
C   K-M-1 continuous derivatives there. If K knots are taken at the same
C   point, then the pp function itself will be discontinuous there.
C
C   Typically, K knots are taken at or to the left of the leftmost data
C   point, K knots at or to the right of the rightmost data point, with
C   the remaining N-K knots in between.  In order for there to be a
C   solution to the interpolation problem the knots T(i), must satisfy
C   certain additional constraints. That is,
C
C                T(i) .LT. X(i) .LT. T(i+K)   i=1,..,N
C
C   Equality is permitted on the left for i=1 and on the right for i=N.
C
C   The three-dimensional interpolant computed by this routine is a
C   tensor product of one-dimensional pp interpolants.  The knots form
C   a grid (TX(i),TY(j),TZ(k)) in the same way that the data points do.
C   Along lines parallel to the coordinate axes, the interpolant reduces
C   to a one-dimensional pp function with order and knots (KX,TX),
C   (KY,TY), or (KZ,TZ). In this case the appropriate constraints on the
C   knots become
C
C            TX(i) .LT. X(i) .LT. TX(i+KX)   i=1,..,NX
C            TY(i) .LT. Y(i) .LT. TY(i+KY)   i=1,..,NY
C            TZ(i) .LT. Z(i) .LT. TZ(i+KZ)   i=1,..,NZ
C
C   with equality on the left permitted when i=1 and equality on the
C   right permitted when i=NX, i=NY and i=NZ respectively.
C
C   If these conditions are violated, then B3INT returns with IFLAG
C   equal to 6, 10 or 14.  The default knot sequence selected by B3INT
C   always satisfies these conditions.
C
C   When the user sets IFLAG=1 B3INT selects knots as follows. KX knots
C   are taken at each endpoint in the x direction, not-a-knot end
C   conditions (see references) are used, and the remaining knots are
C   placed at data points if KX is even or at midpoints between data
C   points if KX is odd.  The y and z directions are treated similarly.
C   This yields a three-dimensional pp function with KX-2, KY-2 and
C   KZ-2 continuous partial derivatives in x, y and z respectively. The
C   interpolant is zero outside the rectangular region defined by the
C   data points, and discontinuous along the boundary of this region.

C   BUPCK is a subsidiary routine called by B3INT.
C
C   BUPCK converts an array packed as though dimensioned as A(NX,NY,NZ)
C   to one dimensioned as A(LD1,LD2,NZ), where LD1.GE.NX and LD2.GE.NY.
C
C   The routine assumes that the input array is packed, that is, the
C   first NX*NY*NZ locations contain data.  It then unpacks the data
C   so that the calling program can dimension it as A(LD1,LD2,NZ).
C   The operation is done in place.

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C   B3VAL evaluates the tensor product piecewise polynomial interpolant
C   constructed by the routine B3INT or one of its derivatives at the
C   point (XVAL,YVAL,ZVAL).  The variables IDX, IDY and IDZ indicate
C   which function is to be evaluated.  If B(x,y,z) is the interpolant,
C
C                            IDX+IDY+IDZ
C                           d
C             B1VAhL  =   ----------------- B (XVAL,YVAL,ZVAL)
C                          IDX   IDY   IDZ
C                        dx    dy    dz
C
C   Thus, to evaluate the interpolant itself, set IDX=IDY=IDZ=0. To get
C   the first partial derivative with respect to x, set IDX=1 and
C   IDY=IDZ=0, and so on.

C   Since B is a piecewise polynomial of degree KX-1 in x, KY-1 in y and
C   KZ-1 in z, B3VAL returns zero whenever IDX.GE.KX or IDY.GE.KY or
C   IDZ.GE.KZ.  B3VAL also returns zero if (XVAL,YVAL,ZVAL) is out of
C   range, that is, if
C
C            XVAL.LT.TX(1) .OR. XVAL.GT.TX(NX+KX) .OR.
C            YVAL.LT.TY(1) .OR. YVAL.GT.TY(NY+KY) .OR.
C            ZVAL.LT.TZ(1) .OR. ZVAL.GT.ZY(NZ+KZ).
C
C   If the knots TX, TY, and TZ were chosen by B3INT, then this is
C   equivalent to
C
C              XVAL.LT.X(1) .OR. XVAL.GT.X(NX) .OR.
C              YVAL.LT.Y(1) .OR. YVAL.GT.Y(NY) .OR.
C              ZVAL.LT.Z(1) .OR. ZVAL.GT.Z(NZ).
C
C   The input quantities TX, TY, TZ, NX, NY, NZ, KX, KY, KZ, and FCN
C   should be unchanged since the call to B3INT which produced FCN.
C
C   Note that the derivative functions computed by B3VAL may be
C   discontinuous when x, y or z correspond to knots.  (When B3INT
C   selects knots this occurs only when IDX=KX-1, IDY=KY-1 or IDZ=KZ-1.)
C   In these cases B3VAL returns right limiting values (right
C   derivatives), except at the rightmost knot where left limiting
C   values are returned.

C   -------------------------------------
C
C   B3VAL is designed so that it will be reasonably efficient when it is
C   being used to evaluate the fitted function on a grid.  The most
C   favorable situation occurs when B3VAL is called repeatedly with the
C   same XVAL, the same IDX and IDY, and slowly increasing YVAL and ZVAL.
C   When calling B3VAL in a triple loop over x, y and z :
C
C     (a) vary x in the OUTER loop, and
C     (b) vary z in the INNER loop, and
C     (c) use separate loops or distinct ICONT,IWORK,WORK for
C         each (IDX,IDY) pair
C
C   A typical example of this usage is as follows.
C
C      ICONT = 0
C      DO 30 I=1,NX
C         DO 20 J=1,NY
C            DO 10 K=1,NZ
C               G(I,J) = B3VAL(X(I),Y(J),Z(K),IDX,IDY,IDZ,TX,TY,TZ,
C     +                        NX,NY,NZ,KX,KY,KZ,FCN,LDF1,LDF2,
C     +                        ICONT,IWORK,WORK,IFLAG)
C               IF (IFLAG .NE. 0) GO TO 9999
C   10       CONTINUE
C   20    CONTINUE
C   30 CONTINUE
C
C   Note that ICONT=0 initially.  This signals B3VAL that it is starting
C   a new function.  B3VAL sets ICONT=1 on output, so ICONT=1 on all
C   subsequent calls, which tells B3VAL to attempt to reuse information
C   from the previous call to speed the evaluation process.

C
C   B3VAL evaluates the following function or its partial derivatives
C
C                      NX   NY   NZ
C        B(x,y,z)  =  SUM  SUM  SUM  FCN(i,j,k) U (x) V (y) W (z)
C                     i=1  j=1  k=1              i     j     k
C   where
C
C     U (x)  is the ith (one-dimensional) B-spline basis function
C      i     defined by NX, KX, and TX,
C
C     V (y)  is the jth (one-dimensional) B-spline basis function
C      j     defined by NY, KY, and TY, and
C
C     W (z)  is the kth (one-dimensional) B-spline basis function
C      k     defined by NZ, KZ, and TZ.
C
C   See (de Boor, 1978) for a description of the B-spline basis.
C
C  The summation above can be rewritten as
C
C                                  NZ
C  (1)               B(x,y,z)  =  SUM  b  V (z),
C                                 k=1   k  k
C  where
C                         NY
C  (2)            b  =   SUM  c   V (y),   k = 1,..,NZ,
C                  k     j=1   jk  j
C  and
C                     NX
C  (3)        c  =   SUM  FCN(i,j,k) U (x),   j = 1,..,NY,
C              jk    i=1              i       k = 1,..,NZ.
C
C  Note that each summation is the evaluation of a one-dimensional
C  B-spline, which can be done by calls to B1VAhL.  At most KZ basis
C  functions in (1) are nonzero.  The indices of these functions are
C  determined, and only the coefficients b(k) which multiply the
C  nonzero basis functions are be computed using (2).  We also
C  observe that at most KY basis functions in (2) are nonzero.  The
C  indices of these functions also are determined and only those
C  coefficients c(j,k) which multiply nonzero basis functions are
C  computed using (3).

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     Abstract
C         BINTh4 computes the B representation (T,BCOEF,N,K) of a
C         cubic spline (K=4) which interpolates data (X(I)),Y(I))),
C         I=1,NDATA.  Parameters IBCL, IBCR, FBCL, FBCR allow the
C         specification of the spline first or second derivative at
C         both X(1) and X(NDATA).  When this data is not specified
C         by the problem, it is common practice to use a natural
C         spline by setting second derivatives at X(1) and X(NDATA)
C         to zero (IBCL=IBCR=2,FBCL=FBCR=0.0).  The spline is defined on
C         T(4) .LE. X .LE. T(N+1) with (ordered) interior knots at X(I))
C         values where N=NDATA+2.  The knots T(1), T(2), T(3) lie to
C         the left of T(4)=X(1) and the knots T(N+2), T(N+3), T(N+4)
C         lie to the right of T(N+1)=X(NDATA) in increasing order.  If
C         no extrapolation outside (X(1),X(NDATA)) is anticipated, the
C         knots T(1)=T(2)=T(3)=T(4)=X(1) and T(N+2)=T(N+3)=T(N+4)=
C         T(N+1)=X(NDATA) can be specified by KNTOPT=1.  KNTOPT=2
C         selects a knot placement for T(1), T(2), T(3) to make the
C         first 7 knots symmetric about T(4)=X(1) and similarly for
C         T(N+2), T(N+3), T(N+4) about T(N+1)=X(NDATA).  KNTOPT=3
C         allows the user to make his own selection, in increasing
C         order, for T(1), T(2), T(3) to the left of X(1) and T(N+2),
C         T(N+3), T(N+4) to the right of X(NDATA) in the work array
C         W(1) through W(6).  In any case, the interpolation on
C         T(4) .LE. X .LE. T(N+1) by using function BVALU is unique
C         for given boundary conditions.

C     Abstract
C         BSPVhD is the BSPLVD routine of the reference.
C
C         BSPVhD calculates the value and all derivatives of order
C         less than NDERIV of all basis functions which do not
C         (possibly) vanish at X.  ILEFT is input such that
C         T(ILEFT) .LE. X .LT. T(ILEFT+1).  A call to INTRhV(T,N+1,X,
C         ILO,ILEFT,MFLAG) will produce the proper ILEFT.  The output of
C         BSPVhD is a matrix VNIKX(I,J) of dimension at least (K,NDERIV)
C         whose columns contain the K nonzero basis functions and
C         their NDERIV-1 right derivatives at X, I=1,K, J=1,NDERIV.
C         These basis functions have indices ILEFT-K+I, I=1,K,
C         K .LE. ILEFT .LE. N. The nonzero part of the I-th basis
C         function lies in (T(I),T(I+K)), I=1,N.
C
C         If X=T(ILEFT+1) then VNIKX contains left limiting values
C         (left derivatives) at T(ILEFT+1).  In particular, ILEFT = N
C         produces left limiting values at the right end point
C         X=T(N+1). To obtain left limiting values at T(I), I=K+1,N+1,
C         set X= next lower distinct knot, call INTRhV to get ILEFT,
C         set X=T(I), and then call BSPVhD.

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C   B2INhT determines the parameters of a function that interpolates the
C   two-dimensional gridded data (X(i),Y(j),FCN(i,j)) for i=1,..,NX and
C   j=1,..,NY.  The interpolating function and its derivatives may be
C   subsequently evaluated by the function B2VAhL.
C
C   The interpolating function is a piecewise polynomial (pp) function
C   represented as a tensor product of one-dimensional B-splines.  The
C   form of this function is
C
C                          NX   NY
C              S(x,y)  =  SUM  SUM  a   U (x) V (y)
C                         i=1  j=1   ij  i     j
C
C   where the functions U(i) and V(j) are one-dimensional B-spline
C   basis functions. The coefficients a(i,j) are chosen so that
C
C         S(X(i),Y(j)) = FCN(i,j)   for i=1,..,NX and j=1,..,NY.
C
C   Note that for each fixed value of y S(x,y) is a pp function of x
C   alone, and for each fixed x S(x,y) is a pp function of y alone.  In
C   one dimension a piecewise polynomial may be created by partitioning
C   a given interval into subintervals and defining a distinct poly-
C   nomial on each one. The points where adjacent subintervals meet are
C   called  knots.  Each of the functions U(i) and V(j) above is a
C   piecewise polynomial.
C
C   Users of B2INhT choose the order (degree+1) of the polynomial pieces
C   used to define the interpolant in each of the x and y directions
C   (KX and KY). Users also may define their own knot sequence in x and
C   y separately (TX and TY).  If IFLAG=0, however, B2INhT will choose
C   knots that result in a pp interpolant with KX-2 continuous partial
C   derivatives in x and KY-2 continuous partial derivatives in y.  The
C   interpolating function is identically zero outside the rectangular
C   region defined by the knots. See below for more information on knot
C   selection.
C
C   After a call to B2INhT, all information necessary to define the
C   interpolating function is contained in the parameters NX, NY, KX,
C   KY, TX, TY, and FCN.  These quantities should not be altered until
C   after the last call of the evaluation routine B2VAhL.

C   ---------------------------
C
C   In this section we describe the relationship between data points
C   and knots.  Users who choose to let B2INhT select the knot sequences
C   TX and TY (by setting IFLAG=1) may skip this discussion.
C
C   To describe the relationship between knots and data points we  first
C   consider the simpler case of one-dimensional interpolation; in
C   particular, we consider interpolating the data X(i), i=1,..,N with
C   a pp function of order K.
C
C   Knots are the points where the individual polynomial pieces join up,
C   and hence where the pp function may suffer a loss of smoothness.  To
C   define a pp function, one needs N+K knots. If the knots are distinct
C   the interpolant will be as smooth as possible (continuous, with K-2
C   continuous derivatives).  If two adjacent knots come together, the
C   smoothness of the function is reduced at that point.  In general, if
C   M knots are assigned to the same point, the pp function will have
C   K-M-1 continuous derivatives there. If K knots are taken at the same
C   point, then the pp function itself will be discontinuous there.
C
C   Typically, K knots are taken at or to the left of the leftmost data
C   point, K knots at or to the right of the rightmost data point, with
C   the remaining N-K knots in between.  In order for there to be a
C   solution to the interpolation problem the knots T(i), must satisfy
C   certain additional constraints. That is,
C
C                T(i) .LT. X(i) .LT. T(i+K)   i=1,..,N
C
C   Equality is permitted on the left for I=1 and on the right for I=N.
C
C   The two-dimensional interpolant computed by this routine is a tensor
C   product of one-dimensional pp interpolants.  The knots form a grid
C   (TX(i),TY(j)) in the same way that the data points do.  Along lines
C   parallel to the coordinate axes, the interpolant reduces to a one-
C   dimensional pp function with order and knots (KX,TX) or (KY,TY). In
C   this case the appropriate constraints on the knots become
C
C            TX(i) .LT. X(i) .LT. TX(i+KX)   i=1,..,NX
C            TY(i) .LT. Y(i) .LT. TY(i+KY)   i=1,..,NY
C
C   with equality on the left permitted when i=1 and equality on the
C   right permitted when i=NX and i=NY, respectively.
C
C   If these conditions are violated, then B2INhT returns with IFLAG
C   equal to 6 or 10.  The default knot sequence selected by B2INhT
C   always satisfies these conditions.
C
C   When the user sets IFLAG=1 B2INhT selects knots as follows. KX knots
C   are taken at each endpoint in the x direction, not-a-knot end
C   conditions (see references) are used, and the remaining knots are
C   placed at data points if KX is even or at midpoints between data
C   points if KX is odd.  The y direction is treated similarly.  This
C   yields a two-dimensional pp function with KX-2 continuous partial
C   derivatives in x and KY-2 continuous partial derivatives in y.  The
C   interpolant is zero outside the rectangular region defined by the
C   data points, and discontinuous along the boundary of this region.

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C   BKNOT is a subsidiary routine called by B2INhT and B3INT.
C
C   BKNOT selects a sequence of N+K knots for use in piecewise
C   polynomial interpolation of order K at a given set of N data points.
C
C   The knots T(i), i=1,..,N+K, are selected as follows:

C     ----------------------------------------------------------------
C     K     at X(1)
C     N-K   between X(1+K/2) and X(N-K+K/2); these are placed at data
C           points if N is even and midway between data points if N is
C           odd
C     K     at X(N)
C
C   where X(i), i=1,..,N are the data points.
C
C   This selection yields an interpolant with K-2 continuous deriva-
C   tives, except at X(1) and X(N); the interpolant will be zero outside
C   (X(1),X(N)).  Knot-a-knot end conditions are used, resulting in K-1

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     Abstract
C
C         BINThK is a modification of the SPLINT routine of reference
C         [de Boor 1979].
C
C         BINThK produces the B-spline coefficients, BCOEF, of the
C         B-spline of order K with knots T(I), I=1,...,N+K, which
C         takes on the value Y(I) at X(I), I=1,...,N.  The spline or
C         any of its derivatives can be evaluated by calls to B1VAhL.
C
C         The I-th equation of the linear system A*BCOEF = B for the
C         coefficients of the interpolant enforces interpolation at
C         X(I), I=1,...,N.  Hence, B(I) = Y(I), for all I, and A is
C         a band matrix with 2K-1 bands if A is invertible.  The matrix
C         A is generated row by row and stored, diagonal by diagonal,
C         in the rows of Q, with the main diagonal going into row K.
C         The banded system is then solved by a call to BNFAhC (which
C         constructs the triangular factorization for A and stores it
C         again in Q), followed by a call to BNSLhV (which then
C         obtains the solution BCOEF by substitution).  BNFAhC does no
C         pivoting, since the total positivity of the matrix A makes
C         this unnecessary.  The linear system to be solved is
C         (theoretically) invertible if and only if
C                 T(I) .LT. X(I) .LT. T(I+K),        for all I.
C         Equality is permitted on the left for I=1 and on the right
C         for I=N when K knots are used at X(1) or X(N).  Otherwise,
C         violation of this condition is certain to lead to an error.

C     Description of Arguments
C
C         Input
C           X      - vector of length N containing data point abscissae

C           K      - order of the spline, K .GE. 1
C
C         Output

C                    abscissae can be obtained by loading YY into

C           WORK   - work vector of length 2*K
C
C     Error Conditions
C         Improper input is a fatal error, as is a singular system of
C         equations.  Conditions checked and their XERMShG error numbers:
C               1   K is less than 1
C               2   N is less than K
C               3   X values are not distinct or not ordered
C               4   Some abscissa was not in the support of the corres-
C                   ponding basis function, and the system is singular.

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C  BNFAhC is the BANFAC routine from
C        * A Practical Guide to Splines *  by C. de Boor
C
C  Returns in  W  the lu-factorization (without pivoting) of the banded
C  matrix  A  of order  NROW  with  (NBANDL + 1 + NBANDU) bands or diag-
C  onals in the work array  W .
C
C *****  I N P U T  ******
C  W.....Work array of size  (NROWW,NROW)  containing the interesting
C        part of a banded matrix  A , with the diagonals or bands of  A
C        stored in the rows of  W , while columns of  A  correspond to
C        columns of  W . This is the storage mode used in  LINPACK  and
C        results in efficient innermost loops.
C           Explicitly,  A  has  NBANDL  bands below the diagonal
C                            +     1     (main) diagonal
C                            +   NBANDU  bands above the diagonal
C        and thus, with    MIDDLE = NBANDU + 1,
C          A(I+J,J)  is in  W(I+MIDDLE,J)  for I=-NBANDU,...,NBANDL
C                                              J=1,...,NROW .
C        For example, the interesting entries of A (1,2)-banded matrix
C        of order  9  would appear in the first  1+1+2 = 4  rows of  W
C        as follows.
C                          13 24 35 46 57 68 79
C                       12 23 34 45 56 67 78 89
C                    11 22 33 44 55 66 77 88 99
C                    21 32 43 54 65 76 87 98
C
C        All other entries of  W  not identified in this way with an en-
C        try of  A  are never referenced .
C  NROWW.....Row dimension of the work array  W .
C        must be  .GE.  NBANDL + 1 + NBANDU  .
C  NBANDL.....Number of bands of  A  below the main diagonal
C  NBANDU.....Number of bands of  A  above the main diagonal .
C
C *****  O U T P U T  ******
C  IFLAG.....Integer indicating success( = 1) or failure ( = 2) .
C     If  IFLAG = 1, then
C  W.....contains the LU-factorization of  A  into a unit lower triangu-
C        lar matrix  L  and an upper triangular matrix  U (both banded)
C        and stored in customary fashion over the corresponding entries
C        of  A . This makes it possible to solve any particular linear
C        system  A*X = B  for  X  by A
C              CALL BNSLhV ( W, NROWW, NROW, NBANDL, NBANDU, B )
C        with the solution X  contained in  B  on return .
C     If  IFLAG = 2, then
C        one of  NROW-1, NBANDL,NBANDU failed to be nonnegative, or else
C        one of the potential pivots was found to be zero indicating
C        that  A  does not have an LU-factorization. This implies that
C        A  is singular in case it is totally positive .
C
C *****  M E T H O D  ******
C     Gauss elimination  W I T H O U T  pivoting is used. The routine is
C  intended for use with matrices  A  which do not require row inter-
C  changes during factorization, especially for the  T O T A L L Y
C  P O S I T I V E  matrices which occur in spline calculations.
C     The routine should not be used for an arbitrary banded matrix.

C     Abstract
C         BSPVhN is the BSPLVN routine of the reference.
C
C         BSPVhN calculates the value of all (possibly) nonzero basis
C         functions at X of order MAX(JHIGH,(J+1)*(INDEX-1)), where
C         T(K) .LE. X .LE. T(N+1) and J=IWORK is set inside the routine
C         on the first call when INDEX=1.  ILEFT is such that T(ILEFT)
C         .LE. X .LT. T(ILEFT+1).  A call to INTRhV(T,N+1,X,ILO,ILEFT,
C         MFLAG) produces the proper ILEFT.  BSPVhN calculates using the
C         basic algorithm needed in BSPVhD.  If only basis functions are
C         desired, setting JHIGH=K and INDEX=1 can be faster than
C         calling BSPVhD, but extra coding is required for derivatives
C         (INDEX=2) and BSPVhD is set up for this purpose.
C
C         Left limiting values are set up as described in BSPVhD.

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C   B2VAhL evaluates the tensor product piecewise polynomial interpolant
C   constructed by the routine B2INhT or one of its derivatives at the
C   point (XVAL,YVAL).  The variables IDX and IDY indicate which
C   function is to be evaluated.  If B(x,y) is the interpolant,
C
C                            IDX+IDY
C                           d
C              B2VAhL  =   ----------- B (XVAL,YVAL)
C                           IDX   IDY
C                         dx    dy
C
C   Thus, to evaluate the interpolant itself, set IDX=IDY=0. To get the
C   first partial derivative with respect to x, set IDX=1 and IDY=0, and
C   so on.
C
C   Since B is a piecewise polynomial of degree KX-1 in x and KY-1 in y,
C   B2VAhL returns zero whenever IDX.GE.KX or IDY.GE.KY.  B2VAhL also
C   returns zero if (XVAL,YVAL) is out of range, that is, if
C
C            XVAL.LT.TX(1) .OR. XVAL.GT.TX(NX+KX) .OR.
C            YVAL.LT.TY(1) .OR. YVAL.GT.TY(NY+KY).
C
C   If the knots TX and TY were chosen by B2INhT, then this is
C   equivalent to
C
C              XVAL.LT.X(1) .OR. XVAL.GT.X(NX) .OR.
C              YVAL.LT.Y(1) .OR. YVAL.GT.Y(NY).
C
C   The input quantities TX, TY, NX, NY, KX, KY, and FCN should be
C   unchanged since the call to B2INhT which produced FCN.
C
C   Note that the derivative functions computed by B2VAhL may be
C   discontinuous when x or y correspond to knots.  (When B2INhT selects
C   knots this occurs only when IDX=KX-1 or IDY=KY-1.)  In these cases
C   B2VAhL returns right limiting values (right derivatives), except at
C   the rightmost knot where left limiting values are returned.

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C   B1VAhL evaluates the B-representation (T,N,K,A) of a spline or one
C   of its derivatives at X.  Variable IDERIV indicates which function
C   is to be evaluated.  If B(x) is the spline,
C
C                              IDERIV
C                             d
C                  B1VAhL  =   -------- B(X)
C                               IDERIV
C                             dx
C
C   Thus, to evaluate the spline itself, set IDERIV=0, to get the first
C   derivative with respect to x, set IDERIV=1, and so on.
C
C   Since B is a piecewise polynomial of degree K-1 B1VAhL returns zero
C   whenever IDERIV.GE.K.  B1VAhL also returns zero if X is out of
C   range, that is, if
C
C                    X.LT.T(1) .OR. X.GT.T(N+K).
C
C   Note that the derivative functions computed by B1VAhL may be
C   discontinuous when X corresponds to a knot.   In these cases B1VAhL
C   returns right limiting values (right derivatives), except at T(N+K)
C   where left limiting values are returned.

C
C  B1VAhL is a version of the routine BVALUE written by Carl de Boor and
C  given in the reference.
C
C  This routine replaces the former SLATEC routine BVALU.  It differs
C  from BVALU in that
C
C    (1) the order of arguments in the calling sequence has been
C        changed and a new parameter, IFLAG, has been added,
C    (2) X may be any real number,
C    (2) IDERIV may be any non-negative integer,
C    (3) right-limiting values are returned when X=T(N+1) and
C        T(N+K).GT.T(N+1), and
C    (4) the prescription given in BVALU for obtaining left-limiting
C        values at interior knots does not work.

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C   B2VA1 evaluates the tensor product piecewise polynomial interpolant
C   constructed by the routine B2INhT or one of its derivatives at the
C   point (XVAL,YVAL).
C   This routine is a modification of B2VAhL, and differs in the use
C   of the input indices IX and IY.  It assumes that B2INhT was called
C   with IFLAG = 1, and KX and KY even, in making use of IX and IY.
C
C   The variables IDX and IDY indicate which
C   function is to be evaluated.  If B(x,y) is the interpolant,
C
C                            IDX+IDY
C                           d
C              B2VA1  =   ----------- B (XVAL,YVAL)
C                           IDX   IDY
C                         dx    dy
C
C   Thus, to evaluate the interpolant itself, set IDX=IDY=0. To get the
C   first partial derivative with respect to x, set IDX=1 and IDY=0, and
C   so on.
C
C   Since B is a piecewise polynomial of degree KX-1 in x and KY-1 in y,
C   B2VA1 returns zero whenever IDX.GE.KX or IDY.GE.KY.  B2VA1 also
C   returns zero if (XVAL,YVAL) is out of range, that is, if
C
C            XVAL.LT.TX(1) .OR. XVAL.GT.TX(NX+KX) .OR.
C            YVAL.LT.TY(1) .OR. YVAL.GT.TY(NY+KY).
C
C   If the knots TX and TY were chosen by B2INhT, then this is
C   equivalent to
C
C              XVAL.LT.X(1) .OR. XVAL.GT.X(NX) .OR.
C              YVAL.LT.Y(1) .OR. YVAL.GT.Y(NY).
C
C   The input quantities TX, TY, NX, NY, KX, KY, and FCN should be
C   unchanged since the call to B2INhT which produced FCN.
C
C   Note that the derivative functions computed by B2VA1 may be
C   discontinuous when x or y correspond to knots.  (When B2INhT selects
C   knots this occurs only when IDX=KX-1 or IDY=KY-1.)  In these cases
C   B2VA1 returns right limiting values (right derivatives), except at
C   the rightmost knot where left limiting values are returned.

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C   B1VA1 evaluates the B-representation (T,N,K,A) of a spline or one
C   of its derivatives at X.  Variable IDERIV indicates which function
C   is to be evaluated.  If B(x) is the spline,
C
C                              IDERIV
C                             d
C                  B1VA1  =   -------- B(X)
C                               IDERIV
C                             dx
C
C   Thus, to evaluate the spline itself, set IDERIV=0, to get the first
C   derivative with respect to x, set IDERIV=1, and so on.
C
C   Since B is a piecewise polynomial of degree K-1 B1VA1 returns zero
C   whenever IDERIV.GE.K.  B1VA1 also returns zero if X is out of
C   range, that is, if
C
C                    X.LT.T(1) .OR. X.GT.T(N+K).
C
C   Note that the derivative functions computed by B1VA1 may be
C   discontinuous when X corresponds to a knot.   In these cases B1VA1
C   returns right limiting values (right derivatives), except at T(N+K)
C   where left limiting values are returned.

C
C  B1VA1 is a version of the routine BVALUE written by Carl de Boor and
C  given in the reference.
C
C  This routine replaces the former SLATEC routine BVALU.  It differs
C  from BVALU in that
C
C    (1) the order of arguments in the calling sequence has been
C        changed and a new parameter, IFLAG, has been added,
C    (2) X may be any real number,
C    (2) IDERIV may be any non-negative integer,
C    (3) right-limiting values are returned when X=T(N+1) and
C        T(N+K).GT.T(N+1), and
C    (4) the prescription given in BVALU for obtaining left-limiting
C        values at interior knots does not work.

C                         (The order of the spline is one more than the
C                         degree of the piecewise polynomial defined on
C                         each interval.  This is consistent with the
C                         B-spline package convention.  For example,
C                         NORD=4 when we are using piecewise cubics.)
C
C      NCONST,XCONST(*),
C      YCONST(*),NDERIV(*)
C                         The number of conditions that constrain the
C                         B-spline is NCONST.  A constraint is specified
C                         by an (X,Y) pair in the arrays XCONST(*) and
C                         YCONST(*), and by the type of constraint and
C                         derivative value encoded in the array
C                         NDERIV(*).  No sorting of XCONST(*) is
C                         required.  The value of NDERIV(*) is
C                         determined as follows.  Suppose the I-th
C                         constraint applies to the J-th derivative
C                         of the B-spline.  (Any non-negative value of
C                         J < NORD is permitted.  In particular the
C                         value J=0 refers to the B-spline itself.)
C                         For this I-th constraint, set
C                          XCONST(I)=X,
C                          YCONST(I)=Y, and
C                          NDERIV(I)=ITYPE+4*J, where
C
C                          ITYPE = 0,      if (J-th deriv. at X) .LE. Y.
C                                = 1,      if (J-th deriv. at X) .GE. Y.
C                                = 2,      if (J-th deriv. at X) .EQ. Y.
C                                = 3,      if (J-th deriv. at X) .EQ.
C                                             (J-th deriv. at Y).
C                          (A value of NDERIV(I)=-1 will cause this
C                          constraint to be ignored.  This subprogram
C                          feature is often useful when temporarily
C                          suppressing a constraint while still
C                          retaining the source code of the calling
C                          program.)
C
C        MODE
C                         An input flgag that directs the least squares
C                         solution method used by FCh( ).
C
C                         The variance function, referred to below,
C                         defines the square of the probable error of
C                         the fitted curve at any point, XVAL.
C                         This feature of  FCh( ) allows one to use the
C                         square root of this variance function to
C                         determine a probable error band around the
C                         fitted curve.
C
C                         =1  a new problem.  No variance function.
C
C                         =2  a new problem.  Want variance function.
C
C                         =3  an old problem.  No variance function.
C
C                         =4  an old problem.  Want variance function.
C
C                         Any value of MODE other than 1-4 is an error.
C
C                         The user with a new problem can skip directly
C                         to the description of the input parameters
C                         IW(1), IW(2).
C
C                         If the user correctly specifies the new or old
C                         problem status, the subprogram FCh( ) will
C                         perform more efficiently.
C                         By an old problem it is meant that subprogram
C                         FCh( ) was last called with this same set of
C                         knots, data points and weights.
C
C                         Another often useful deployment of this old
C                         problem designation can occur when one has
C                         previously obtained a Q-R orthogonal
C                         decomposition of the matrix resulting from
C                         B-spline fitting of data (without constraints)
C                         at the breakpoints BKPT(I), I=1,...,NBKPT.
C                         For example, this matrix could be the result
C                         of sequential accumulation of the least
C                         squares equations for a very large data set.
C                         The user writes this code in a manner
C                         convenient for the application.  For the
C                         discussion here let
C
C                                      N=NBKPT-NORD, and K=N+3
C
C                         Let us assume that an equivalent least squares
C                         system
C
C                                      RC=D
C
C                         has been obtained.  Here R is an N+1 by N
C                         matrix and D is a vector with N+1 components.
C                         The last row of R is zero.  The matrix R is
C                         upper triangular and banded.  At most NORD of
C                         the diagonals are nonzero.
C                         The contents of R and D can be copied to the
C                         working array W(*) as follows.
C
C                         The I-th diagonal of R, which has N-I+1
C                         elements, is copied to W(*) starting at
C
C                                      W((I-1)*K+1),
C
C                         for I=1,...,NORD.
C                         The vector D is copied to W(*) starting at
C
C                                      W(NORD*K+1)
C
C                         The input value used for NDATA is arbitrary
C                         when an old problem is designated.  Because
C                         of the feature of FCh( ) that checks the
C                         working storage array lengths, a value not
C                         exceeding NBKPT should be used.  For example,
C                         use NDATA=0.
C
C                         (The constraints or variance function request
C                         can change in each call to FCh( ).)  A new
C                         problem is anything other than an old problem.
C
C      IW(1),IW(2)
C                         The amounts of working storage actually
C                         allocated for the working arrays W(*) and
C                         IW(*).  These quantities are compared with the
C                         actual amounts of storage needed in FCh( ).
C                         Insufficient storage allocated for either
C                         W(*) or IW(*) is an error.  This feature was
C                         included in FCh( ) because misreading the
C                         storage formulas for W(*) and IW(*) might very
C                         well lead to subtle and hard-to-find
C                         programming bugs.
C
C                         The length of W(*) must be at least
C
C                           NB=(NBKPT-NORD+3)*(NORD+1)+
C                               2*MAX(NDATA,NBKPT)+NBKPT+NORD**2
C
C                         Whenever possible the code uses banded matrix
C                         processors BNDAChC( ) and BNDSOhL( ).  These
C                         are utilized if there are no constraints,
C                         no variance function is required, and there
C                         is sufficient data to uniquely determine the
C                         B-spline coefficients.  If the band processors
C                         cannot be used to determine the solution,
C                         then the constrained least squares code LSEIh
C                         is used.  In this case the subprogram requires
C                         an additional block of storage in W(*).  For
C                         the discussion here define the integers NEQCON
C                         and NINCON respectively as the number of
C                         equality (ITYPE=2,3) and inequality
C                         (ITYPE=0,1) constraints imposed on the fitted
C                         curve.  Define
C
C                           L=NBKPT-NORD+1
C
C                         and note that
C
C                           NCONST=NEQCON+NINCON.
C
C                         When the subprogram FCh( ) uses LSEIh( ) the
C                         length of the working array W(*) must be at
C                         least
C
C                           LW=NB+(L+NCONST)*L+
C                              2*(NEQCON+L)+(NINCON+L)+(NINCON+2)*(L+6)
C
C                         The length of the array IW(*) must be at least
C
C                           IW1=NINCON+2*L
C
C                         in any case.

C  Output..
C      MODE
C                         An output flag that indicates the status

C                              In case the working arrays W(*) or IW(*)
C                              are not long enough, the minimal
C                              acceptable length is printed.

C
C      COEFF(*)
C                         If the output value of MODE=0 or 1, this array
C                         contains the unknowns obtained from the least
C                         squares fitting process.  These N=NBKPT-NORD
C                         parameters are the B-spline coefficients.
C                         For MODE=1, the equality constraints are
C                         contradictory.  To make the fitting process
C                         more robust, the equality constraints are
C                         satisfied in a least squares sense.  In this
C                         case the array COEFF(*) contains B-spline
C                         coefficients for this extended concept of a
C                         solution.  If MODE=-1,2 or 3 on output, the
C                         array COEFF(*) is undefined.

C  Working Arrays..
C      W(*),IW(*)
C                         These arrays are respectively typed real and
C                         INTEGER.
C                         Their required lengths are specified as input
C                         parameters in IW(1), IW(2) noted above.  The
C                         contents of W(*) must not be modified by the
C                         user if the variance function is desired.
C
C  Evaluating the
C  Variance Function..
C                         To evaluate the variance function (assuming
C                         that the uncertainties of the Y values were
C                         provided to  FCh( ) and an input value of
C                         MODE=2 or 4 was used), use the function
C                         subprogram  CV( )
C
C                           VAR=CV(XVAL,NDATA,NCONST,NORD,NBKPT,
C                                  BKPT,W)
C
C                         Here XVAL is the point where the variance is
C                         desired.  The other arguments have the same
C                         meaning as in the usage of FCh( ).
C
C                         For those users employing the old problem
C                         designation, let MDATA be the number of data
C                         points in the problem.  (This may be different
C                         from NDATA if the old problem designation
C                         feature was used.)  The value, VAR, should be
C                         multiplied by the quantity
C
C                         real(MAX(NDATA-N,1))/MAX(MDATA-N,1)
C
C                         The output of this subprogram is not defined
C                         if an input value of MODE=1 or 3 was used in
C                         FCh( ) or if an output value of MODE=-1, 2, or
C                         3 was obtained.  The variance function, except
C                         for the scaling factor noted above, is given
C                         by
C
C                           VAR=(transpose of B(XVAL))*C*B(XVAL)
C
C                         The vector B(XVAL) is the B-spline basis
C                         function values at X=XVAL.
C                         The covariance matrix, C, of the solution
C                         coefficients accounts only for the least
C                         squares equations and the explicitly stated
C                         equality constraints.  This fact must be
C                         considered when interpreting the variance
C                         function from a data fitting problem that has
C                         inequality constraints on the fitted curve.
C
C  Evaluating the
C  Fitted Curve..
C                         To evaluate derivative number IDER at XVAL,
C                         use the function subprogram BVALU( ).
C
C                           F = BVALU(BKPT,COEFF,NBKPT-NORD,NORD,IDER,

C                         The output of this subprogram will not be

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     These subroutines solve the least squares problem Ax = b for
C     banded matrices A using sequential accumulation of rows of the
C     data matrix.  Exactly one right-hand side vector is permitted.
C
C     These subroutines are intended for the type of least squares
C     systems that arise in applications such as curve or surface
C     fitting of data.  The least squares equations are accumulated and
C     processed using only part of the data.  This requires a certain
C     user interaction during the solution of Ax = b.
C
C     Specifically, suppose the data matrix (A B) is row partitioned
C     into Q submatrices.  Let (E F) be the T-th one of these
C     submatrices where E = (0 C 0).  Here the dimension of E is MT by N
C     and the dimension of C is MT by NB.  The value of NB is the
C     bandwidth of A.  The dimensions of the leading block of zeros in E
C     are MT by JT-1.
C
C     The user of the subroutine BNDAChC provides MT,JT,C and F for
C     T=1,...,Q.  Not all of this data must be supplied at once.
C
C     Following the processing of the various blocks (E F), the matrix
C     (A B) has been transformed to the form (R D) where R is upper
C     triangular and banded with bandwidth NB.  The least squares
C     system Rx = d is then easily solved using back substitution by
C     executing the statement CALL BNDSOhL(1,...). The sequence of
C     values for JT must be nondecreasing.  This may require some
C     preliminary interchanges of rows and columns of the matrix A.
C
C     The primary reason for these subroutines is that the total
C     processing can take place in a working array of dimension MU by
C     NB+1.  An acceptable value for MU is
C
C                       MU = MAX(MT + N + 1),
C
C     where N is the number of unknowns.
C
C     Here the maximum is taken over all values of MT for T=1,...,Q.
C     Notice that MT can be taken to be a small as one, showing that
C     MU can be as small as N+2.  The subprogram BNDAChC processes the
C     rows more efficiently if MU is large enough so that each new
C     block (C F) has a distinct value of JT.
C
C     The four principle parts of these algorithms are obtained by the
C     following call statements
C
C     CALL BNDAChC(...)  Introduce new blocks of data.
C
C     CALL BNDSOhL(1,...)Compute solution vector and length of
C                       residual vector.

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     DIMENSION A(MDA,N),(B(MDB,NB) or B(M)),RNORM(NB),H(N),G(N),IP(N)
C
C     This subroutine solves a linear least squares problem or a set of
C     linear least squares problems having the same matrix but different
C     right-side vectors.  The problem data consists of an M by N matrix
C     A, an M by NB matrix B, and an absolute tolerance parameter TAU
C     whose usage is described below.  The NB column vectors of B
C     represent right-side vectors for NB distinct linear least squares
C     problems.
C
C     This set of problems can also be written as the matrix least
C     squares problem
C
C                       AX = B,
C
C     where X is the N by NB solution matrix.
C
C     Note that if B is the M by M identity matrix, then X will be the
C     pseudo-inverse of A.
C
C     This subroutine first transforms the augmented matrix (A B) to a
C     matrix (R C) using premultiplying Householder transformations with
C     column interchanges.  All subdiagonal elements in the matrix R are
C     zero and its diagonal elements satisfy
C
C                       ABS(R(I,I)).GE.ABS(R(I+1,I+1)),
C
C                       I = 1,...,L-1, where
C
C                       L = MIN(M,N).
C
C     The subroutine will compute an integer, KRANK, equal to the number
C     of diagonal terms of R that exceed TAU in magnitude. Then a
C     solution of minimum Euclidean length is computed using the first
C     KRANK rows of (R C).
C
C     To be specific we suggest that the user consider an easily
C     computable matrix norm, such as, the maximum of all column sums of
C     magnitudes.
C
C     Now if the relative uncertainty of B is EPS, (norm of uncertainty/
C     norm of B), it is suggested that TAU be set approximately equal to
C     EPS*(norm of A).
C
C     The user must dimension all arrays appearing in the call list..
C     A(MDA,N),(B(MDB,NB) or B(M)),RNORM(NB),H(N),G(N),IP(N).  This
C     permits the solution of a range of problems in the same array
C     space.
C
C     The entire set of parameters for HFTIh are
C
C     INPUT..
C
C     A(*,*),MDA,M,N    The array A(*,*) initially contains the M by N
C                       matrix A of the least squares problem AX = B.
C                       The first dimensioning parameter of the array
C                       A(*,*) is MDA, which must satisfy MDA.GE.M
C                       Either M.GE.N or M.LT.N is permitted.  There
C                       is no restriction on the rank of A.  The
C                       condition MDA.LT.M is considered an error.
C
C     B(*),MDB,NB       If NB = 0 the subroutine will perform the
C                       orthogonal decomposition but will make no
C                       references to the array B(*).  If NB.GT.0
C                       the array B(*) must initially contain the M by
C                       NB matrix B of the least squares problem AX =
C                       B.  If NB.GE.2 the array B(*) must be doubly
C                       subscripted with first dimensioning parameter
C                       MDB.GE.MAX(M,N).  If NB = 1 the array B(*) may
C                       be either doubly or singly subscripted.  In
C                       the latter case the value of MDB is arbitrary
C                       but it should be set to some valid integer
C                       value such as MDB = M.
C
C                       The condition of NB.GT.1.AND.MDB.LT. MAX(M,N)
C                       is considered an error.
C
C     TAU               Absolute tolerance parameter provided by user
C                       for pseudorank determination.
C
C     H(*),G(*),IP(*)   Arrays of working space used by HFTIh.
C
C     OUTPUT..
C
C     A(*,*)            The contents of the array A(*,*) will be
C                       modified by the subroutine. These contents
C                       are not generally required by the user.
C
C     B(*)              On return the array B(*) will contain the N by
C                       NB solution matrix X.
C
C     KRANK             Set by the subroutine to indicate the
C                       pseudorank of A.
C
C     RNORM(*)          On return, RNORM(J) will contain the Euclidean
C                       norm of the residual vector for the problem
C                       defined by the J-th column vector of the array
C                       B(*,*) for J = 1,...,NB.
C
C     H(*),G(*)         On return these arrays respectively contain
C                       elements of the pre- and post-multiplying
C                       Householder transformations used to compute
C                       the minimum Euclidean length solution.
C
C     IP(*)             Array in which the subroutine records indices
C                       describing the permutation of column vectors.
C                       The contents of arrays H(*),G(*) and IP(*)
C                       are not generally required by the user.

C     Abstract
C
C     This subprogram solves a linearly constrained least squares
C     problem with both equality and inequality constraints, and, if the
C     user requests, obtains a covariance matrix of the solution
C     parameters.
C
C     Suppose there are given matrices E, A and G of respective
C     dimensions ME by N, MA by N and MG by N, and vectors F, B and H of
C     respective lengths ME, MA and MG.  This subroutine solves the
C     linearly constrained least squares problem
C
C                   EX = F, (E ME by N) (equations to be exactly
C                                       satisfied)
C                   AX = B, (A MA by N) (equations to be
C                                       approximately satisfied,
C                                       least squares sense)
C                   GX .GE. H,(G MG by N) (inequality constraints)
C
C     The inequalities GX .GE. H mean that every component of the
C     product GX must be .GE. the corresponding component of H.
C
C     In case the equality constraints cannot be satisfied, a
C     generalized inverse solution residual vector length is obtained
C     for F-EX.  This is the minimal length possible for F-EX.
C
C     Any values ME .GE. 0, MA .GE. 0, or MG .GE. 0 are permitted.  The
C     rank of the matrix E is estimated during the computation.  We call
C     this value KRANKE.  It is an output parameter in IP(1) defined
C     below.  Using a generalized inverse solution of EX=F, a reduced
C     least squares problem with inequality constraints is obtained.
C     The tolerances used in these tests for determining the rank
C     of E and the rank of the reduced least squares problem are
C     given in Sandia Tech. Rept. SAND-78-1290.  They can be
C     modified by the user if new values are provided in
C     the option list of the array PRGOPT(*).
C
C     The user must dimension all arrays appearing in the call list..
C     W(MDW,N+1),PRGOPT(*),X(N),WS(2*(ME+N)+K+(MG+2)*(N+7)),IP(MG+2*N+2)
C     where K=MAX(MA+MG,N).  This allows for a solution of a range of
C     problems in the given working space.  The dimension of WS(*)
C     given is a necessary overestimate.  Once a particular problem
C     has been run, the output parameter IP(3) gives the actual
C     dimension required for that problem.
C
C     The parameters for LSEIh( ) are
C
C     Input..
C
C     W(*,*),MDW,   The array W(*,*) is doubly subscripted with
C     ME,MA,MG,N    first dimensioning parameter equal to MDW.
C                   For this discussion let us call M = ME+MA+MG.  Then
C                   MDW must satisfy MDW .GE. M.  The condition
C                   MDW .LT. M is an error.
C
C                   The array W(*,*) contains the matrices and vectors
C
C                                  (E  F)
C                                  (A  B)
C                                  (G  H)
C
C                   in rows and columns 1,...,M and 1,...,N+1
C                   respectively.
C
C                   The integers ME, MA, and MG are the
C                   respective matrix row dimensions
C                   of E, A and G.  Each matrix has N columns.
C
C     PRGOPT(*)    This real-valued array is the option vector.
C                  If the user is satisfied with the nominal
C                  subprogram features set
C
C                  PRGOPT(1)=1 (or PRGOPT(1)=1.0)
C
C                  Otherwise PRGOPT(*) is a linked list consisting of
C                  groups of data of the following form
C
C                  LINK
C                  KEY
C                  DATA SET
C
C                  The parameters LINK and KEY are each one word.
C                  The DATA SET can be comprised of several words.
C                  The number of items depends on the value of KEY.
C                  The value of LINK points to the first
C                  entry of the next group of data within
C                  PRGOPT(*).  The exception is when there are
C                  no more options to change.  In that
C                  case, LINK=1 and the values KEY and DATA SET
C                  are not referenced.  The general layout of
C                  PRGOPT(*) is as follows.
C
C               ...PRGOPT(1) = LINK1 (link to first entry of next group)
C               .  PRGOPT(2) = KEY1 (key to the option change)
C               .  PRGOPT(3) = data value (data value for this change)
C               .       .
C               .       .
C               .       .
C               ...PRGOPT(LINK1)   = LINK2 (link to the first entry of
C               .                       next group)
C               .  PRGOPT(LINK1+1) = KEY2 (key to the option change)
C               .  PRGOPT(LINK1+2) = data value
C               ...     .
C               .       .
C               .       .
C               ...PRGOPT(LINK) = 1 (no more options to change)
C
C                  Values of LINK that are nonpositive are errors.
C                  A value of LINK .GT. NLINK=100000 is also an error.
C                  This helps prevent using invalid but positive
C                  values of LINK that will probably extend
C                  beyond the program limits of PRGOPT(*).
C                  Unrecognized values of KEY are ignored.  The
C                  order of the options is arbitrary and any number
C                  of options can be changed with the following
C                  restriction.  To prevent cycling in the
C                  processing of the option array, a count of the
C                  number of options changed is maintained.
C                  Whenever this count exceeds NOPT=1000, an error
C                  message is printed and the subprogram returns.
C
C                  Options..
C
C                  KEY=1
C                         Compute in W(*,*) the N by N
C                  covariance matrix of the solution variables
C                  as an output parameter.  Nominally the
C                  covariance matrix will not be computed.
C                  (This requires no user input.)
C                  The data set for this option is a single value.
C                  It must be nonzero when the covariance matrix
C                  is desired.  If it is zero, the covariance
C                  matrix is not computed.  When the covariance matrix
C                  is computed, the first dimensioning parameter
C                  of the array W(*,*) must satisfy MDW .GE. MAX(M,N).
C
C                  KEY=10
C                         Suppress scaling of the inverse of the
C                  normal matrix by the scale factor RNORM**2/
C                  MAX(1, no. of degrees of freedom).  This option
C                  only applies when the option for computing the
C                  covariance matrix (KEY=1) is used.  With KEY=1 and
C                  KEY=10 used as options the unscaled inverse of the
C                  normal matrix is returned in W(*,*).
C                  The data set for this option is a single value.
C                  When it is nonzero no scaling is done.  When it is
C                  zero scaling is done.  The nominal case is to do
C                  scaling so if option (KEY=1) is used alone, the
C                  matrix will be scaled on output.
C
C                  KEY=2
C                         Scale the nonzero columns of the
C                         entire data matrix.
C                  (E)
C                  (A)
C                  (G)
C
C                  to have length one.  The data set for this
C                  option is a single value.  It must be
C                  nonzero if unit length column scaling
C                  is desired.
C
C                  KEY=3
C                         Scale columns of the entire data matrix
C                  (E)
C                  (A)
C                  (G)
C
C                  with a user-provided diagonal matrix.
C                  The data set for this option consists
C                  of the N diagonal scaling factors, one for
C                  each matrix column.
C
C                  KEY=4
C                         Change the rank determination tolerance for
C                  the equality constraint equations from
C                  the nominal value of SQRT(SRELPR).  This quantity can
C                  be no smaller than SRELPR, the arithmetic-
C                  storage precision.  The quantity SRELPR is the
C                  largest positive number such that T=1.+SRELPR
C                  satisfies T .EQ. 1.  The quantity used
C                  here is internally restricted to be at
C                  least SRELPR.  The data set for this option
C                  is the new tolerance.
C
C                  KEY=5
C                         Change the rank determination tolerance for
C                  the reduced least squares equations from
C                  the nominal value of SQRT(SRELPR).  This quantity can
C                  be no smaller than SRELPR, the arithmetic-
C                  storage precision.  The quantity used
C                  here is internally restricted to be at
C                  least SRELPR.  The data set for this option
C                  is the new tolerance.
C
C                  For example, suppose we want to change
C                  the tolerance for the reduced least squares
C                  problem, compute the covariance matrix of
C                  the solution parameters, and provide
C                  column scaling for the data matrix.  For
C                  these options the dimension of PRGOPT(*)
C                  must be at least N+9.  The Fortran statements
C                  defining these options would be as follows:
C
C                  PRGOPT(1)=4 (link to entry 4 in PRGOPT(*))
C                  PRGOPT(2)=1 (covariance matrix key)
C                  PRGOPT(3)=1 (covariance matrix wanted)
C
C                  PRGOPT(4)=7 (link to entry 7 in PRGOPT(*))
C                  PRGOPT(5)=5 (least squares equas.  tolerance key)
C                  PRGOPT(6)=... (new value of the tolerance)
C
C                  PRGOPT(7)=N+9 (link to entry N+9 in PRGOPT(*))
C                  PRGOPT(8)=3 (user-provided column scaling key)
C
C                  CALL SCOPY (N, D, 1, PRGOPT(9), 1)  (Copy the N
C                    scaling factors from the user array D(*)
C                    to PRGOPT(9)-PRGOPT(N+8))
C
C                  PRGOPT(N+9)=1 (no more options to change)
C
C                  The contents of PRGOPT(*) are not modified
C                  by the subprogram.
C                  The options for WNNLhs( ) can also be included
C                  in this array.  The values of KEY recognized
C                  by WNNLhs( ) are 6, 7 and 8.  Their functions
C                  are documented in the usage instructions for
C                  subroutine WNNLhs( ).  Normally these options
C                  do not need to be modified when using LSEIh( ).
C
C     IP(1),       The amounts of working storage actually
C     IP(2)        allocated for the working arrays WS(*) and
C                  IP(*), respectively.  These quantities are
C                  compared with the actual amounts of storage
C                  needed by LSEIh( ).  Insufficient storage
C                  allocated for either WS(*) or IP(*) is an
C                  error.  This feature was included in LSEIh( )
C                  because miscalculating the storage formulas
C                  for WS(*) and IP(*) might very well lead to
C                  subtle and hard-to-find execution errors.
C
C                  The length of WS(*) must be at least
C
C                  LW = 2*(ME+N)+K+(MG+2)*(N+7)
C
C                  where K = max(MA+MG,N)
C                  This test will not be made if IP(1).LE.0.
C
C                  The length of IP(*) must be at least
C
C                  LIP = MG+2*N+2

C
C     X(*),RNORME,  The array X(*) contains the solution parameters
C     RNORML        if the integer output flag MODE = 0 or 1.
C                   The definition of MODE is given directly below.
C                   When MODE = 0 or 1, RNORME and RNORML
C                   respectively contain the residual vector
C                   Euclidean lengths of F - EX and B - AX.  When
C                   MODE=1 the equality constraint equations EX=F

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This is a companion subprogram to WNNLhs.
C     The documentation for WNNLhs has complete usage instructions.
C
C     In addition to the parameters discussed in the prologue to
C     subroutine WNNLhs, the following work arrays are used in
C     subroutine WNLShM  (they are passed through the calling
C     sequence from WNNLhs for purposes of variable dimensioning).
C     Their contents will in general be of no interest to the user.
C
C         IPIVOT(*)
C            An array of length N.  Upon completion it contains the
C         pivoting information for the cols of W(*,*).
C
C         ITYPE(*)
C            An array of length M which is used to keep track
C         of the classification of the equations.  ITYPE(I)=0
C         denotes equation I as an equality constraint.
C         ITYPE(I)=1 denotes equation I as a least squares
C         equation.
C
C         WD(*)
C            An array of length N.  Upon completion it contains the
C         dual solution vector.
C
C         H(*)
C            An array of length N.  Upon completion it contains the
C         pivot scalars of the Householder transformations performed
C         in the case KRANK.LT.L.
C
C         SCALE(*)
C            An array of length M which is used by the subroutine
C         to store the diagonal matrix of weights.
C         These are used to apply the modified Givens
C         transformations.
C
C         Z(*),TEMP(*)
C            Working arrays of length N.
C
C         D(*)
C            An array of length N that contains the
C         column scaling for the matrix (E).

C     Abstract
C
C     This subprogram solves a linearly constrained least squares
C     problem.  Suppose there are given matrices E and A of
C     respective dimensions ME by N and MA by N, and vectors F
C     and B of respective lengths ME and MA.  This subroutine
C     solves the problem
C
C               EX = F, (equations to be exactly satisfied)
C
C               AX = B, (equations to be approximately satisfied,
C                        in the least squares sense)
C
C               subject to components L+1,...,N nonnegative
C
C     Any values ME.GE.0, MA.GE.0 and 0.LE. L .LE.N are permitted.
C
C     The problem is reposed as problem WNNLhS
C
C               (WT*E)X = (WT*F)
C               (   A)    (   B), (least squares)
C               subject to components L+1,...,N nonnegative.
C
C     The subprogram chooses the heavy weight (or penalty parameter) WT.
C
C     The parameters for WNNLhS are
C
C     INPUT..
C
C     W(*,*),MDW,  The array W(*,*) is double subscripted with first
C     ME,MA,N,L    dimensioning parameter equal to MDW.  For this
C                  discussion let us call M = ME + MA.  Then MDW
C                  must satisfy MDW.GE.M.  The condition MDW.LT.M
C                  is an error.
C
C                  The array W(*,*) contains the matrices and vectors
C
C                       (E  F)
C                       (A  B)
C
C                  in rows and columns 1,...,M and 1,...,N+1
C                  respectively.  Columns 1,...,L correspond to
C                  unconstrained variables X(1),...,X(L).  The
C                  remaining variables are constrained to be
C                  nonnegative. The condition L.LT.0 or L.GT.N is
C                  an error.
C
C     PRGOPT(*)    This real-valued array is the option vector.
C                  If the user is satisfied with the nominal
C                  subprogram features set
C
C                  PRGOPT(1)=1 (or PRGOPT(1)=1.0)
C
C                  Otherwise PRGOPT(*) is a linked list consisting of
C                  groups of data of the following form
C
C                  LINK
C                  KEY
C                  DATA SET
C
C                  The parameters LINK and KEY are each one word.
C                  The DATA SET can be comprised of several words.
C                  The number of items depends on the value of KEY.
C                  The value of LINK points to the first
C                  entry of the next group of data within
C                  PRGOPT(*).  The exception is when there are
C                  no more options to change.  In that
C                  case LINK=1 and the values KEY and DATA SET
C                  are not referenced. The general layout of
C                  PRGOPT(*) is as follows.
C
C               ...PRGOPT(1)=LINK1 (link to first entry of next group)
C               .  PRGOPT(2)=KEY1 (key to the option change)
C               .  PRGOPT(3)=DATA VALUE (data value for this change)
C               .       .
C               .       .
C               .       .
C               ...PRGOPT(LINK1)=LINK2 (link to the first entry of
C               .                       next group)
C               .  PRGOPT(LINK1+1)=KEY2 (key to the option change)
C               .  PRGOPT(LINK1+2)=DATA VALUE
C               ...     .
C               .       .
C               .       .
C               ...PRGOPT(LINK)=1 (no more options to change)
C
C                  Values of LINK that are nonpositive are errors.
C                  A value of LINK.GT.NLINK=100000 is also an error.
C                  This helps prevent using invalid but positive
C                  values of LINK that will probably extend
C                  beyond the program limits of PRGOPT(*).
C                  Unrecognized values of KEY are ignored.  The
C                  order of the options is arbitrary and any number
C                  of options can be changed with the following
C                  restriction.  To prevent cycling in the
C                  processing of the option array a count of the
C                  number of options changed is maintained.
C                  Whenever this count exceeds NOPT=1000 an error
C                  message is printed and the subprogram returns.
C
C                  OPTIONS..
C
C                  KEY=6
C                         Scale the nonzero columns of the
C                  entire data matrix
C                  (E)
C                  (A)
C                  to have length one. The DATA SET for
C                  this option is a single value.  It must
C                  be nonzero if unit length column scaling is
C                  desired.
C
C                  KEY=7
C                         Scale columns of the entire data matrix
C                  (E)
C                  (A)
C                  with a user-provided diagonal matrix.
C                  The DATA SET for this option consists
C                  of the N diagonal scaling factors, one for
C                  each matrix column.
C
C                  KEY=8
C                         Change the rank determination tolerance from
C                  the nominal value of SQRT(SRELPR).  This quantity
C                  can be no smaller than SRELPR, The arithmetic-
C                  storage precision.  The quantity used
C                  here is internally restricted to be at
C                  least SRELPR.  The DATA SET for this option
C                  is the new tolerance.
C
C                  KEY=9
C                         Change the blow-up parameter from the
C                  nominal value of SQRT(SRELPR).  The reciprocal of
C                  this parameter is used in rejecting solution
C                  components as too large when a variable is
C                  first brought into the active set.  Too large
C                  means that the proposed component times the
C                  reciprocal of the parameter is not less than
C                  the ratio of the norms of the right-side
C                  vector and the data matrix.
C                  This parameter can be no smaller than SRELPR,
C                  the arithmetic-storage precision.
C
C                  For example, suppose we want to provide
C                  a diagonal matrix to scale the problem
C                  matrix and change the tolerance used for
C                  determining linear dependence of dropped col
C                  vectors.  For these options the dimensions of
C                  PRGOPT(*) must be at least N+6.  The FORTRAN
C                  statements defining these options would
C                  be as follows.
C
C                  PRGOPT(1)=N+3 (link to entry N+3 in PRGOPT(*))
C                  PRGOPT(2)=7 (user-provided scaling key)
C
C                  CALL SCOPY(N,D,1,PRGOPT(3),1) (copy the N
C                  scaling factors from a user array called D(*)
C                  into PRGOPT(3)-PRGOPT(N+2))
C
C                  PRGOPT(N+3)=N+6 (link to entry N+6 of PRGOPT(*))
C                  PRGOPT(N+4)=8 (linear dependence tolerance key)
C                  PRGOPT(N+5)=... (new value of the tolerance)
C
C                  PRGOPT(N+6)=1 (no more options to change)
C
C
C     IWORK(1),    The amounts of working storage actually allocated
C     IWORK(2)     for the working arrays WORK(*) and IWORK(*),
C                  respectively.  These quantities are compared with
C                  the actual amounts of storage needed for WNNLhS( ).
C                  Insufficient storage allocated for either WORK(*)
C                  or IWORK(*) is considered an error.  This feature
C                  was included in WNNLhS( ) because miscalculating

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C   SSORhT sorts array X and optionally makes the same interchanges in
C   array Y.  The array X may be sorted in increasing order or
C   decreasing order.  A slightly modified quicksort algorithm is used.
C
C   Description of Parameters
C      X - array of values to be sorted   (usually abscissas)
C      Y - array to be (optionally) carried along
C      N - number of values in array X to be sorted
C      KFLAG - control parameter
C            =  2  means sort X in increasing order and carry Y along.
C            =  1  means sort X in increasing order (ignoring Y)
C            = -1  means sort X in decreasing order (ignoring Y)
C            = -2  means sort X in decreasing order and carry Y along.
