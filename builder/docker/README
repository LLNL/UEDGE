The Docker container for building/running the Basis Uedge version can be
created here. This requires that Docker is installed. Test the Docker
installation by running the hello world container with
"docker run -it --rm hello-world". It's a good idea to do a "make realclean" 
to remove local containers and images. It will force pulls of current Docker
containers. 

Once Docker is confirmed to run just do a "make". The Makefile "push" target
is included for developer convenience but will only work for users with access
to the Docker account.

This build depends on the existance of the Basis container (fusionbillm/basis)
which is built and uploaded seperate from Uedge.
