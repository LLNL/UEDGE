UEDGE is an interactive suite of physics packages using the Python or BASIS scripting systems. The original (circa 2007) Python version was further developed under the FACETS SciDAC project [Cary 2008, McCourt 2012]. The plasma is described by time-dependent 2D plasma fluid equations that include equations for density, velocity, ion temperature, electron temperature, electrostatic potential, and gas density in the edge region of a magnetic fusion energy confinement device. slab, cylindrical, and toroidal geometries are allowed, and closed and open magnetic field-line regions are included. Classical transport is assumed along magnetic field lines, and anomalous transport is assumed across field lines.  Multi-charge state impurities can be included with the corresponding line-radiation energy loss.
