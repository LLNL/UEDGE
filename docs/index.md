# UEDGE
A 2D time-dependent fluid simulation code of plasma and neutrals in magnetic fusion devices.
## Brief description 
UEDGE is an interactive suite of physics packages using the Python or BASIS scripting systems. 
The original (circa 2007) Python version was further developed under the FACETS SciDAC project 
[Cary 2008, McCourt 2012]. The plasma is described by time-dependent 2D plasma fluid equations 
that include equations for density, velocity, ion temperature, electron temperature, electrostatic 
potential, and gas density in the edge region of a magnetic fusion energy confinement device. slab, 
cylindrical, and toroidal geometries are allowed, and closed and open magnetic field-line regions 
are included. Classical transport is assumed along magnetic field lines, and anomalous transport 
is assumed across field lines.  Multi-charge state impurities can be included with the corresponding 
line-radiation energy loss. 

## Method of solution
A fully implicit numerical algorithm is used that allows both Newton-like iterations to steady state 
and time-dependent solutions with large time-steps.  A preconditioning matrix is obtained by approximate 
(ILUT) inversion of a numerical finite-difference Jacobian, which is then used in a Newton-Krylov 
solution algorithm. A finite-volume differencing algorithm is used. Over 95% of the coding is in 
Fortran with the remainder being C.

## Related and auxiliary software

Although UEDGE is written in Fortran, for efficient execution and analysis of results, it utilizes 
either Python or BASIS scripting shells. Python is easily available for many platforms 
(http://www.Python.org/). The features and availability of BASIS are described in "Basis Manual Set" 
by P.F. Dubois, Z.C. Motteler, et al., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory report UCRL-MA-118541, 
June, 2002 and http://basis.llnl.gov/), however, BASIS is deprecated. Contact one of the UEDGE developers
if you insist on running it within that environment. 
The Python version of UEDGE uses the same source files but utilizes Forthon to produce a Python-compatible 
source.  Forthon has been developed by D.P. Grote (see http://hifweb.lbl.gov/Forthon/ and Grote et al. 
in the references below), and it is freely available. The graphics can be performed by any package importable 
to Python, such as PYGIST.  The parallel version of UEDGE available through Python also uses the PETSc linear 
algebra solver whose development has been led by ANL (https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/).

UEDGE can also be coupled to other codes.  An excellent example is couplling to the DUSTT code from
UCSD (contact rsmirnov@eng.ucsd.edu) that follows the trajectories and ablation of dust particles in
the background UEDGE plasma and provides impurity sources to UEDGE.  For an example, see R. Smirnov
et al., Phys. Plasmas 22 (2015) 012506.

## Getting started 
The easiest way to try out UEDGE is to download a static executable that should run on any Linux system; see
the link to the executable [see uedge_executable file].  The second method is to download the UEDGE source files, and then build a Python
version or a Basis version [see uedge_source directory].

## How to get involved and contribute
Sent email to one of the developers listed below expressing your interest in modifying or developing packages 
for UEDGE.  Either new or improved physics models or numerical algorithms are most welcome.
