UEDGE is in a transitional phase from running in the BASIS environment, 
developed at LLNL, to Python. This version, tagged $Name:  $, can 
run in both environments. If you have interest in the Basis version of 
UEDGE contact Bill Meyer (meyer8@llnl.gov). New installations of the 
Basis version are discouraged as there is no longer any official support 
for the Basis software. Unless you know otherwise, assume this checkout 
is intended for building the Python UEDGE module. The remainder of these 
installation instructions apply only to the Python version of UEDGE. The 
Python version of UEDGE has been build on several Linux distributions and 
on MacOSX High Sierra and Mojave. 


Building Python UEDGE (pyUedge).

    Prerequisites:
        - Python 2.7
              We recommend the Anaconda (2) Python data science distribution. 
              This includes many useful packages. Besides the base Python 
              packages pyUedge includes Python scripts that utilize the 
              matplotlib and hdf5 packages. Numpy is a required package to 
              build pyUedge.

        - Fortran/C compilers
              Only gfortran and gcc have been tested. 

    Requisites:
        - Forthon 
           Generates link between UEDGE Fortran and Python.
           pip install forthon
        - MPPL (More Productive Programming Language)
           MPPL is a Fortran preprocessor
           pip install mppl
           

     Install with pip:
        pip install uedge
        
        ****Note that there was a version numbering change. If a 
        "pip show uedge" reports version 7.6 then a "pip uninstall uedge" 
        and "pip install --no-cache-dir uedge" will be nesseccary.

     Install from git clone:
       python setup.py build
       python setup.py install
