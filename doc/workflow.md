# UEDGE GitHub Workflow Guide
**Parallel Major Versions (v8 / v9) – GitFlow‑ish, PEP 621, Rebase‑First**

This document is the **authoritative workflow specification** for all development,
maintenance, and release activity in **UEDGE**.

It is written for:
- New contributors unfamiliar with GitHub
- Experienced developers
- Release managers and maintainers

Shorthand instructions found in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

---

## 1. Supported Major Versions

### v8 – Current Baseline
- Default development version
- Receives **all active physics, bugfix, and feature work**
- Branches:
  - `main` (released code)
  - `develop` (integration)

### v9 – Next Major Revision
- Major restructuring and reformatting
- Branches:
  - `v9-main`
  - `v9-develop`
- Receives **explicit backports** from v8 where applicable

---

## 2. Core Rules

1. `main` and `v9-main` are always releasable
2. All work happens on **feature branches**
3. Feature branches target **exactly one major version**
4. Rebase only short‑lived branches
5. Backports are labeled, tracked, and cherry‑picked
6. Inactive branches are archived, then deleted

---

## 3. Branch Model

### Long‑lived branches

| Branch | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| main | Released v8 code |
| develop | Active v8 development |
| v9-main | Released v9 code |
| v9-develop | Active v9 development |

### Short‑lived branches

Naming is **mandatory**:

- `feature/v8-*`, `bugfix/v8-*`
- `feature/v9-*`, `bugfix/v9-*`
- `release/v8-x.y.z`, `release/v9-x.y.z`
- `hotfix/v8-x.y.z`, `hotfix/v9-x.y.z`

Feature branches:
- Are based on the matching `develop-*`
- Are the **only branches that accept PRs**
- Must be rebased before merge

---

### Stale Branches

This section defines how **inactive branches** are archived and eventually removed, while
preserving scientific history and ensuring repository hygiene. Maintainer instructions
relating to stale branches located in [doc/maintainers/stale-branches.md](doc/maintainers/stale-branches.md).

#### Definition of a Stale Branch

A branch is considered **stale** if **all** of the following are true:

- No commits for **12 months**
- No open or merged pull requests for **12 months**
- Not referenced by:
  - an active release
  - an open issue or milestone
  - current development plans

#### Stale Branch Lifecycle

Stale branch handling follows a **two-stage lifecycle**: archive, then delete.

##### 1. Archive (Rename to `stale/*`)

When a branch meets the stale criteria:

- The branch is renamed to:
  ```
  stale/<original-branch-name>
  ```
- Renaming preserves the full commit history.
- Archived branches are **read-only** and **not valid PR targets**.

Branch protection is **automatically applied** to all `stale/*` branches via
GitHub Actions, enforcing:
- no direct pushes
- no force-pushes
- no deletions
- PRs blocked or restricted to maintainers

##### 2. Documentation and Notification

Every archived branch must be documented:

- A tracking issue is opened noting:
  - branch name
  - last activity date
  - reason for archival
  - planned deletion date (archive + 12 months)
- An entry is added to the stale branch log:
  - `docs/stale-branches-log.md`

This ensures transparency and auditability.

##### 3. Deletion (After Archive Period)

After **12 additional months** in the archived (`stale/*`) state:

- The branch may be deleted if no renewed development need exists.
- A final notice is added to the tracking issue.
- The deletion date is recorded in the stale branch log.

##### 4. Revival (If Needed)

If development must resume:

- Create a new active branch from the stale branch tip:
  ```
  feature/v8-<topic>
  feature/v9-<topic>
  ```
- Development must **not** occur directly on `stale/*` branches.
- The new work should reference the original stale branch and tracking issue.

#### Maintainer Responsibility

- Only maintainers may archive or delete branches.
- Maintainers must follow the documented checklist:
  - `docs/maintainers/stale-branches.md`
- Deviations require explicit maintainer approval.

---

This policy ensures inactive work is preserved responsibly while keeping the active
development surface clean and understandable.


## 4. Pull Requests

- PRs target **feature branches only**
- Feature branches are merged into `develop-*`
- No direct PRs to `main-*` or `develop-*`
- Maintainers perform integration

---

## 5. Versioning (PEP 621 / PEP 440)

Defined in `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project]
version = "1.8.2"
```

Examples:
- Final: `1.8.2`
- RC: `1.9.0rc1`
- Hotfix: `1.8.3`

Git tags:
- `v1.8.2`
- `v1.9.0rc1`

---

## 6. Backport Policy (v8 → v9)

### Required Labels
Exactly **one** required on every v8 PR:

- `backport-needed-v9`
- `backport-complete-v9`
- `no-backport`
- `v9-only`

### Backport Method
**Cherry‑pick only**:

```bash
git checkout v9-develop
git cherry-pick <commit>
git push
```

### Squashing Guidance
To minimize cherry‑picks:
- Squash or rebase feature PRs before merge
- Prefer one logical commit per PR

---

## 7. Release Workflow

1. Create `release/vX-Y.Z` from `develop-vX`
2. Stabilize (bugfixes, docs, packaging only)
3. Update version in `pyproject.toml`
4. Merge into:
   - `main-vX`
   - `develop-vX`
5. Tag on `main-vX`

This workflow is **recommended best practice** for parallel major versions.

---


## 8. Decision Table

| Change Type | Target |
|------------|-------|
| Bugfix to released code | develop |
| Physics / features | develop |
| Breaking / structural | v9-develop |
| Docs | Most relevant active branch |

---

## 9. Breaking Changes & Deprecation

- Breaking changes allowed **only in v9**
- Must be documented in release notes
- Deprecations:
  - Warn in v8
  - Remove in v9

This document governs all UEDGE GitHub activity.
