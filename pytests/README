This python test area is setup to be run with the "pytest" module. You may 
need to load this into your Anaconda Python environment with:

    pip install pytest pytest-xdist

Then to run all the tests type:

    pytest --forked

To run just the fast tests to:

    pytest --forked fast_tests

To run just a specific test you can either do this while in this directory:

    pytest --forked fast_tests/Slab_geometry

or

    cd fast_tests/Slab_geometry
    pytest --forked

Repeat for any desired test.
